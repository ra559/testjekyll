Whenever you feel down, call me. <br>
I will listen to each word you say <br>
I will do anything to make you feel better <br>
All you need to do is call. <br>

Years will go by and my name may never live in your mind <br>
But if one day life kicks you hard <br>
Call me. I can always talk <br>
And If I am far away, I will come by if you need me to <br>

Even when I am gone <br>
I wonâ€™t really be away <br>
I will always be a phone call away <br>
I am loyal like that. <br>
