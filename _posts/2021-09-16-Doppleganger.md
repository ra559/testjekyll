In German, it means look-alike<br>
Maybe one day Iâ€™ll find yours<br>
Just like you<br>
Same smile, same hair, same perfume<br>

And suddenly one day<br>
In the bus or in the train<br>
In my way to work or a bar in the day<br>
I come across those beautiful eyes<br>

Maybe she will look at me and will look at her<br>
I will find you and she wont know a thing<br>
I will remember how to live<br>
The memories of love will revive in me<br>

The goodbye we never said<br>
That hello we would like to say<br>
I will tell them to her<br>
And maybe she will stare at my soul and find in me what you did<br>
