I can tell you that I miss your body - your sex <br>
But you know that already <br>
What you don't know is the things I really miss <br>
I miss watching movies at night with you <br>

From those movie moments <br>
I miss laying my head in your legs <br>
I miss getting you another drink <br>
I even miss pausing the movie for you to go piss <br>

I miss arguing about Ella y El <br>
We will never agree on that song <br>
I miss those short conversations <br>
Did you like the movie? I miss asking that <br>

I miss offering you a beer <br>
I miss calling and asking if you want wine <br>
I miss us <br>
I miss your warm body next to mine <br>

And those days when nature did not let me have you <br>
I miss bothering you about it <br>
Come on lets do it! Please! <br>
I miss begging you for you know what ... <br>

See, It is not the sex but the person <br>
It is not the erections but the kisses <br>
And is not being your man <br>
It is being the love of your life <br>
