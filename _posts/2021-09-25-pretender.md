I need to do better at hiding my pain <br>
It is bleeding everywhere and it sucks they can tell <br>
I need to appear happy every day <br>
Nicotine is not helping me marinate. <br>

I am picking up new hobbies <br>
Maybe, hiking new trails or dining in hotel lobbies <br>
Make more jokes or order pizza with anchovies <br>
Bang some random pussy; collect more trophies. <br>

Write more happy poems <br>
Sing more happy songs or sonnets <br>
Put simile faces in my Instagram comments <br>
Pretend to be the me who die that horrible moment. <br>

But I could never pretend with her <br>
She is the only one who can see the facade <br>
This is insane. To her, I should lie as well <br>
I hurt her when she reads sadness in my parade. <br>
