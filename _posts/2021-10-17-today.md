Today is a good day because yesterday is over <br>
The sun is good to me and the rest of the people <br>
There is a small chill in the morning signature of October <br>
The winter is just around the corner <br>

Today is a good day to kiss you <br>
Today is a good day for hugs and snuggles <br>
Yesterday was not bad but today is better <br>
Today I smile. Tomorrow, I don't know <br>

Today is a good day to discover a new song <br>
To Google its lyrics and create platonic scenarios <br>
Today is a good day to make love <br>
Furious love. Crazy love. Intoxicating Love. <br>
