I hear the drums echoing tonight <br>
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation <br>
She's coming in, 12:30 flight <br>
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation <br>
I stopped an old man along the way <br>
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies <br>
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" <br>

<b>It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa <br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh) <b> <br>

The wild dogs cry out in the night <br>
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company <br> 
I know that I must do what's right <br>
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti <br>
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become <br>

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa <br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh) <br>

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you <br>

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa <br>
(I bless the rain) <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rain) <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa (ah, gonna take the time) <br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh) <br>
