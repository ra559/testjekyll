Sometimes we get that weird phone call <br>
Not the extended car warranty insurance <br>
But the one from that person you have not talk to for a while <br>
That electric feeling when you see their name on the screen <br>

People do that to us <br>
They make us feel good by just existing <br>
The thought that they still feel for us gives us hope <br>
Hope that maybe we are not that worthless <br>

Maybe the call is from a lost love <br>
That one that got away <br> 
Maybe it is from an old friend <br>
That one you got drunk with years ago <br>

But those calls have a way to revive us <br>
A way to makes live again <br>
It makes dream of the past <br>
It reboots the heart. <br>
