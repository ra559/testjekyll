Let’s do it in the car <br>
Right here in this desert parking lot <br>
Let the light of the lamppost draw the shadow of our bodies <br>
Come on! I want to and you want me to <br>
 
Let’s remember that first time <br>
I will eat your world and you will cry <br>
Let me make you mine here one more time <br>
Let me lose myself and the rush of time <br>

Don't tell them anything <br>
If they call, say you went to the store <br>
Stop by when we are done <br>
So that the bags disguise the lie <br>

Escape your life for an hour or two <br>
Meet me here and I will be with you <br>
I promise you I won't hold you tight <br>
Actually, I will but I'll let you go in time. <br>
