I have no idea what to tell you <br>
I do not know what to write <br>
Today, words don’t really rhyme <br>
Don’t misunderstand. I don't feel bad. <br>

It is just that I want to say more than I love you <br>
I want to yell something else other than I miss you <br>
I want to tell you dirty things and get you warm <br>
But I want to say new things to you as well. <br>

You probably tired of reading the same thing over and over <br>
And I promised you a poem every day <br>
So I am writing you today to tell you <br>
That I want to give you something new. <br>

I want you to keep experiencing new things with me <br>
And honestly, it scares me to know that one day nothing else will be new <br>
And then what will I do? <br>
For sure, I will have to invent new ways to amaze you. <br>

But today, let me keep raining over the same wet floor <br>
I miss you and need you like never before <br>
I crave you like i have never had  <br>
And I am going crazy knowing that you I will never have. <br>

Don't think even for a second that I got tired <br>
That idea does not belong in your head <br>
I will never be tired of writing for you <br>
I will never ever stop loving you. <br>

Call me crazy or call me insane <br>
Say all the things you want to say <br>
Call an obsession if that helps you stay <br>
But this ocean I have inside will never dry away. <br>
