I sat down next to her on the couch<br>
We played our favorite songs for a while<br>
I sang, horribly, my favorite ones<br>
She laugh and we drank light<br>

And I woke up from a beautiful dream<br>
A dream of the past<br>
When I was happy<br>
When she was my one<br>

I am going to bed again<br>
To pray to God or the Devil<br>
To let men dream again<br>
There I can live happiness one more time<br>

Ignorance is bliss<br>
Sometimes not knowing is the best thing<br>
But this time I wish I could turn back time<br>
For a time I was better. To a time I was another.<br>
