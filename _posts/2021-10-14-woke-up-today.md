I woke up today thinking about the things that matter <br>
I spend the first 30 minutes of my day contemplating my life <br>
I chew again all my failures  <br>
I smiled one more time at my achievements <br>

Today was a bad day and I donâ€™t know if tomorrow will be better <br>
I do not worry about tomorrow today or today about the future <br>
Life is too uncertain to worry about tomorrow <br>
We do not even have the next 15 minutes certain.  <br>

I counted today as another fight won <br>
Depression did not win. <br>
I saw and kissed her again <br>
I worked hard and did my job <br>
All those things but, her in particular, made today a win! <br>
