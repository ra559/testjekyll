De tanto cantarle al amor y la vida <br>
Me quedé sin amor una noche de un día <br>
De tanto jugar con quien yo más quería <br>
Perdí, sin querer <br>
Lo mejor que tenía <br>

[Me Olvide De Vivir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i88gbcGaKg) by Julio Iglesias <br>

It is sad when loss comes upon us,  <br>
It is even sadder when one comes to realization <br>
That one was always destined to lose <br>
It is life to play the game of loser and winner <br>

How are we supposed to know which is the right move? <br>
When every step we take feeds the entropy of this world <br>
Today, what might seem like the right choice <br>
Can always end as the worst mistake you ever made <br>

So I live by a simple philosophy <br>
“To live is to risk it all” <br>
And yes, those are words from Rick <br>
But how right was he? <br>

Now, I live for the sake of been alive <br>
I keep in mind the little wins <br>
And when the rain of my failures pours hard on my days <br>
I cling to those little wins as a beam of sunlight. <br>

Tomorrow will be a brighter day <br>
Because tomorrow always comes <br>
One lonely day, tomorrow will be late <br>
And then, there will be no rain and no goodbyes. <br>
