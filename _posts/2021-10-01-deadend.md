I walk a lonely path <br>
In the road, voices echo <br>
The mumble words and phrases <br>
But I a deaf man hears no words <br>

In this path, the light is in the end <br>
My tunnel vision focuses on the goal <br>
My feet are tired but I keep walking <br>
I can feel the stones in the road penetrating my skin <br>

There, where the road ends <br>
I know I will find you <br>
My Anabel Lee will be there <br>
Standing, with tears waiting for me <br>
