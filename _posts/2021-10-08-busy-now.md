Im busy now - She told me <br>
I noticed a weird emotion in her voice <br>
I did not asked her what was wrong <br>
I figured she will tell me if it bothers her enough. <br>

Call me back when you are done - I told her anxious to talk <br>
Hours went by and she never called <br>
A day or two passed and my number she blocked <br>
A month went by and she called me back. <br>

She was crying - non stop crying <br>
I did not asked her anything just let her tears run <br>
She did not know that I was already in my car <br>
I simply asked her “Where are you right now?” <br>

I'm at the park where we used to hang out. <br>
This late? - I asked pretending I was not on my way <br>
I needed to think and then I needed someone to talk  <br>
You can always talk to me - I told her, turning to the right road. <br>

When she saw me she tried to run <br>
But I catched her and hugged her for 1 minute too long <br>
She looked at me with red eyes <br>
I looked at her and we sat waiting for her sadness to die. <br>

She told me everything that was going on <br>
In silence, I listened and told her “I know” <br>
She told me about that guy who left her alone <br>
“fuck him!” to him, this sadness, you shall never show <br>

And she sat quietly for almost an hour <br>
I did not say a word. Did not ask any questions <br>
I stared at her and softly said “If you need me, I’ll be your rock” <br>
Just like that we reconnected and she went home. <br>

The next morning she called me <br>
She told me “lo que hiciste ayer fue un error” <br>
I told her “You needed someone and I will never say no” <br>
She hung up the phone and I waited for her to call. <br>

She did call the same day <br>
She told me if it was possible to see me tonight <br>
I told her that she need never ask me that <br>
Regardless of the time that passed, I will always have her back. <br>
