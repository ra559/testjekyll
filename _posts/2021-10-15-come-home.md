Hey you know what?<br>
I am hungry today.<br>
I am hungry for that succulent dish you have between your legs<br>
I am starving for it!<br>

So why donâ€™t you come home and bring me some of that paradise?<br>
How about you quench this hunger with your body?<br>
I want you tonight more than I have desired you all my life<br>
It feels like I have not seen you in centuries<br>
And this hunger is killing me, so, please!! come feed me<br>

I want to start with you neck <br>
I want to hear your heavy breathing <br>
Every time my tongue runs from left to right<br>
I want to make quick stops in those flavorful lips of yours<br>

I want to lose myself in your breast<br>
I want to pretend that they are my sea<br>
In which I am hunting my moby dick<br>
I want to caress them and hear your moans of craziness<br>

I will make you go insane just with my mouth and my words<br>
You will wish this moment last forever<br>
It will be your favorite form of heroine <br>
Because you know I understand your body<br>
You know that you are my favorite book, movie, and song<br>

I will conquer every inch of your body with my tongue<br>
There won't be a spot I won't kiss<br>
There wont be a thing I will miss<br>
And for days and maybe months <br>
You will remember that holy hour where you were mine and I was yours<br>
