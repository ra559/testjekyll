These are the little things that you do that make me happy <br>
Every morning when you text me “Good Morning” <br>
My day starts better than if the sun itself were to wake me up <br>
I spend all day waiting for the next text with anticipation building up slowly. <br>

Every time you ask me to bring you coffee <br>
I want to stop what I am doing and go right away <br>
Because I know I will see you and my heart will come back to life <br>
Feeling alive again, even for an instance, is worth the drive. <br>

When you answer simple questions with approval <br>
It brings too much joy like if those words were heroin to my soul <br>
I don't care how simple the question is <br>
It is simply the fact that you take those seconds to reply. <br>

When I have this stupid requests to come see me for 5 minutes <br>
And you take that time and multiply it in a single hug <br>
That makes me feel incredible  <br>
So much I cannot even describe it <br>

When you look at me with those eyes i don’t understand <br>
Eyes that sometimes look in love and other times look sad <br>
Eyes that sometimes I lose myself in trying to find who I am <br>
Eyes that say a lot and nothing at the same time. <br>

When you look at me wanting a kiss but cannot say the words <br>
So I steal and you return it back with double the passion <br>
You body language says a lot when your words are lost <br>
It is that instant that I live every day for. <br>

When you invite me to walk with you <br>
Although I know that it is just to walk <br>
I get excited because I know that we can talk <br>
I know that I can steal another kiss and another hug. <br>

It is those little things that give me the energy to continue <br>
That makes me happy. That return me to myself <br>
Those little moments get me out of this hole <br>
And in the darkest days, their memories work as a sunbeam of the brightest light. <br>
