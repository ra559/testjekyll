Meet me by the bridge tonight <br>
By the same place you meet me every time <br>
Meet me to kiss me like the last time <br>
To have you on top of me and feel your warmth <br>

Meet me there tonight <br>
Don’t be afraid I won’t bite <br>
Well, I lied <br>
I will bite your lower lip and grab you just like that <br>

Maybe I will kidnap you this time <br>
Take you far away from here  <br>
Take you with me and this time it will last <br>
Maybe a life together does not sound that bad <br>

Come out to play with me tonight <br>
There won't be a thing to regret  <br>
Once our naked bodies meet again <br>
Come with me for another time <br>
