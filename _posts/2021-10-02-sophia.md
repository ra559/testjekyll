She has these eyes full of sadness <br>
Clearly, she had a difficult life <br>
Probably she had her heart broken countless times <br>
She has an amazing physic <br>
And that is a magnet for weak bad men. <br>

I make a lot of assumptions based on how she looks at me <br>
She is probably wondering if I am just the same <br>
Like the other man who broke her down to pieces <br>
That guy who lied even about his name <br>
That guy who today not even his number she keeps <br>

But she still looks at me with curiosity <br>
She stares at the eyes of Lucifer and wonders <br>
Will he hurt me too? Will he be the one? <br>
Sophia, start living and stop thinking. <br>

We see each other on the train <br>
Every morning, she buys the same coffee <br>
A small late from the Starbucks at New York train station <br>
In her best days, she wears a long dress that paints her curves <br>
In her low days, she wears tight jeans that make every man turn. <br>

I have seen many approach her  <br>
But she looks at them and rejects them without a single word <br>
They all fail, give up and I never see them again <br>
I have never talked to her. We just talk with our eyes  <br>
Every time they meet, we have entire conversations just looking at each other. <br>

She works in a cosmetic company just a building after mine <br>
Looking at her demeanor, I think she works as Sales Rep. <br>
Maybe tomorrow I seat next to her <br>
And Like the others before me, fail at having a conversation and move on <br>.
