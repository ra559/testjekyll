Like staring at a waterfall <br>
Looking at nature painting with the water <br>
Creating clouds in the bottom <br> 
That is how beautiful she is to me <br>

When I look into her eyes <br>
I lose myself in a universe <br>
I see never-ending stars shine <br>
A complete galaxy floating in there <br> 

I donâ€™t believe in any gods <br> 
But the fact that she exists <br>
The fact that she is this special to me <br> 
May be reason enough to believe <br>
