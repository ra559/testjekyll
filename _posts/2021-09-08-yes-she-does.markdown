![she is amazing](https://c.tenor.com/KaVRYnod3S4AAAAC/sad-bye.gif)<br>

She does that to me <br>
She chews me up and leave her marks <br>
I do not complaint. I like the pain <br>
She sees my souls for what it is. Dark <br>

She matches my feelings and regrets <br>
She speaks a language I sometimes understand  <br>
But when I do, it is just the right words to tell <br>
and when I don't, its like finding a needle in sand <br>

She loves me in her own way <br>
But it is a way that makes no sense <br>
Do I want it to make it someday? <br>
No. I like it cryptic in her defense <br>
