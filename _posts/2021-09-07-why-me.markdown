Why me?

**Her:** *Why are you doing all of these?* <br>
**Me:** *Because I love you* <br>
**Her:** *Love fades away* <br>
**Me:** *My love for your will never go away. I may become dumb but it my love will remain* <br>
**Her:** *Wanna bet?* <br>
**Me:** *Yes. If in 5 years I am still in love with you. You will let me make love to you again like the first time.* <br>
**Her:** *and if not, you will take me to Paris.* <br>
**Me:** *Can I go with you?* <br>

She asks me **why I love her** <br>
I tell her **because I do** <br>
She yells **"I don't deserve it!"** <br>
I say the heart has no compass, logic, **no rules** <br>
 
I want her happy and better if it is **with me** <br>
Im selfish because she is all **to me** <br>
Maybe one day she'll **see** <br>
Im nothing without her. **Do you know what I mean?** <br>

She thinks I am **crazy** <br>
Yes I am. I am insanely in love and a little **lazy** <br>
She does not believe me and that **is fine** <br>
Without her my heart soaks in deadly **brine** <br>

He may love her **a lot** <br>
He may not love her **at all** <br>
But how **I love her** <br>
Causes every cell in her body **to stir**. <br>
