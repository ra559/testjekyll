I took a decision that day my heart blew up <br>
I had to decide whether I should fight or let you go <br>
And the easy path is to accept defeat <br>
But I am not a coward! I choose you. <br>

I decided that I will fight for this love I feel <br>
I will become the best! A perfect me <br>
One that can deserve you <br>
Because the crazy ones nev <br>er give up. <br>

I choose you! I will not stop until I meet my goals <br>
And If in the end I lose <br>
I will accept that I never deserved you <br>
And I will find something else to do. <br>

If I give up now I prove them right <br>
And they are wrong so what's the point? <br>
You are worth everything to me  <br>
And they will see that one day <br>

When they see that the time did not erase you from me <br>
That men came and went but they never measure to what we had <br>
That women tried to emulate you and failed every time <br>
They will then understand the meaning of love <br>

Because I fight for what I love <br>
And what I love is you <br>
I want you to be my wife  <br>
And that will never change with time. <br>

Even after you hate me for never changing my mind <br>
Even after you curse me for always been there <br>
Even after I lose everyone around me for holding on to this love <br>
I will still fight for you! I will die fighting for this love! <br>
