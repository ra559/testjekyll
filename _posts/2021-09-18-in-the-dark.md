I sit here in the dark<br>
My phone screen glowing my face<br>
I wait in silence a message from you<br>
It's been hours and nothing comes.<br>

I come here every day after work<br>
This deserted parking lot<br>
It has become my church of loneliness. My home<br>
Hours come and go and I stare at my phone<br>

Messages come but they are not yours<br>
I ignore them all. They don't matter. <br>
A drop of water in the ocean<br>
Every notification brings my heart to a stop<br>

But it is not you<br>
It is anothouyt email <br>
Another stupit notificacion<br>
The word game asking me to play<br>

And I go home to the lonely bed<br>
I go to sleep to dream of you<br>
And tomorrow at around 10 PM<br>
My ritual begins again. <br>
