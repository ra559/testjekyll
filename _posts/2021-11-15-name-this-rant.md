I do not want to forget you <br>
I do not want to lose you <br>
I do not want you to stop loving me <br>
I am selfish because I want you for me <br>

But letâ€™s assume that I want to forget you <br>
Sorry honey! It is too late <br>
It has been too late since the first day I met you <br>
Since that night we shared a pack of peanuts M&Ms <br>
I got your number and you got my name. <br>

All I do is miss you every day <br>
How can anyone expect me to do anything else? <br>
Anything else other than loving you as hard as I can <br>
Anything else other than working for you. <br>

I hate that I cannot help you more <br>
I hate that I am not successful enough for you <br>
Enough for you to not work as hard <br>
I hate a lot of things <br>
But the one I hate the most is losing you <br>
