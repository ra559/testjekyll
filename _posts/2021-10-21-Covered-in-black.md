Dark, black, obsidian <br>
It covers the treasure I long for <br>
I hides away what I dream of every night <br>
It separates me from the pleasure of discovery <br>
It keeps me anxious. It makes me mad <br>

The cloth i touch is soft and gentle <br>
The secret behind is tender and sweet <br>
I want to remove it  <br>
From here on I canâ€™t hold it no more <br>

Dark, Black, Obsidian <br>
It's the color of what she hides from me <br>
I love it black because it calls my name on her <br>
Dark, Black, Obsidian <br>
That is the color of her underwear tonight <br>
