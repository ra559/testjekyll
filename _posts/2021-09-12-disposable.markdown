Here. In this deserted parking lot <br>
In the arms of a dream, I fall<br>
The future memories trap my thoughts <br>
I cant sleep. I cant think. I cant let go<br>

In this kingdom of pain, I reign <br>
Trying to fly with broken wings <br>
An empty palace is my head <br>
I live this life in vein  <br>

Hope fell asleep in my arms <br> 
In this sea of confusion<br>
Good and evil are twins <br>
Love and hate best friends  <br>
 
Im not a hero in my tale <br>
In not a villain in my book <br>
In this movie, i'm the disposable one <br>
The guy in the first season no one remembers by the third <br>
