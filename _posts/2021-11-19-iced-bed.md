![sad bed](https://data.whicdn.com/images/69520997/original.jpg)<br>

Cold, empty, and heartless <br>
Laying here I feel the ice of the sheets <br>
The loneliness that hugs me tight <br>
The air poisoned with solitude <br>

Last night, I missed you the most <br>
I could hear your voice <br>
I tried to reach you knowing well you were not there <br>
Letting my heart sink <br>
Knowing you will never be <br>

Maybe tonight Iâ€™ll drink enough  <br>
To make this phantosmia of you perfume go away <br>
It is hard to teach my skin <br>
To not miss your warmth at night <br>
It is even harder to train my lips <br>
To enjoy others like yours they once did. <br>
