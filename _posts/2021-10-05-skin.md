Let me talk you about the softest surface I have touched <br>
Every time my fingers get into contact with it <br>
I feel like if I am touching clouds of feathers <br>
I’m talking about the skin of my lover! <br>

I caress her face and it feels unique <br>
So soft and delicate you could fall asleep touching her <br>
It feels sweet in my hands as if that could be possible <br>
It feels warm yet cold at the same time. <br>

And have I talked to you about the taste? <br>
It is Nirvana in my mouth! <br>
I cannot stop kissing her neck face and breast!  <br>
I cannot hold back and bite! I am in love! <br>

Have talked to you about her smell? <br>
My God! It is like the most addictive drug <br>
Extacy, cocaine, even meth do not hold a candle to her <br>
When I see her, I want to die in her neck! <br>

Really! I’m in love with her! <br>
