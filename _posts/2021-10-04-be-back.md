Listen! I want you back <br>
And I won’t be with you today or tomorrow <br>
But I want you back! <br>
So I will become the best man I can be <br>
Because I want you back! <br>

I want you to be my wife <br>
I want to put a ring with my name on your hand <br>
I want my last name and yours to rhyme <br>
And I don't care how long it takes me to achieve that! <br>

I want those lips to be mine <br>
I want you by my side when I die <br>
So I will wait as many years needed to go by <br>
And I will be back! Because we are eternal <br>
I will prove you that with time <br>

Maybe when I’m 50 will be the right time <br>
Maybe by then I am everything every woman wants <br>
And I will be exactly the man that deserves you <br>
And like if I never left, I will be back! <br>

I will kiss you like the first and last time <br>
And we will makle love like in-love tenagers one more time! <br>
My success and failures in life <br>
Will all be for the fact of getting you back! <br>
