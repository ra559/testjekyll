That smile <br>
That talk <br>
That Walk <br>
It is perfect
You know how it goes. <br>

What wouldnâ€™t I do for another chance? <br>
Baby, I would split the sea in two or maybe 3 <br>
Walk a thousand miles and maybe a thousand more <br>
Become whatever I have to be so I can be yours <br>

What will I do for another chance? <br>
That answer you will have to see <br>
As time flies and I keep on wanting you back <br>
As this page grows with poems and stories of us <br>

And I will surely take my time this time <br>
Enjoy every second with you and your love ones <br>
I do not have to make you a priority  <br>
Because you already are <br>

And will probably spend a lifetime <br>
Fighting for another chance <br>
Building myself for you one more time <br>
And showing the world how wonderful you are <br>
