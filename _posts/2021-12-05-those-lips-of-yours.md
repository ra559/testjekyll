I love them. <br>
They are the sweetest nectar <br>
The softest surface <br>
The warmest feeling <br>

Those lips of yours <br>
They have me enchanted <br>
All I want to do is feel them <br>
Make them mine
You and them with me for an eternity <br>

Those lips of yours my queen <br>
Are all I long in this difficult times <br>
When my soul is dark and my thoughts full of turbulence <br>

Those lips of yours rescue you me  <br>
Bring me back from darkness <br>
Make me whole when I am in  pieces <br>

Those lips of yours are the incarnation of this love <br>
Perfect! Just like you. <br>
Pure! Just like heaven <br>
Alive! Just like the vast ocean. <br>
