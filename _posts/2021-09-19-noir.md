In dark a see her face, <br>
She smiles because she knows i'm looking <br>
Lucifer is watching and she gets aroused <br>
Her eyes locked into mine. <br>

It is always like this with me <br>
I swim in the vast ocean of her look <br>
Those eyes carry a warmth I cannot get enough of <br>
Just a look and I melt. <br>

She always has a question in her eyes <br>
I wish I knew what it was <br>
I ask but she says nothing <br>
And that is the beauty of it <br>

Her eyes scream happiness <br>
My touches make her skin beg for more <br>
My lips make her lose her mind <br>
Her lips make me addicted for life. <br>
