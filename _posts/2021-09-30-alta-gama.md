Don't talk to me about ambitions  <br>
If you wake up every day content with where you are  <br>
Don't talk to me about wanting more  <br>
If you are today in the same place you were last year.  <br>

Don't talk to me about dreams  <br>
If you are doing nothing to achieve them  <br>
Don't talk to me about getting far  <br>
If you are not walking no where  <br>

Don't talk to me about progress  <br>
If you are not working on building your skill set  <br>
Working on becoming a bigger beast  <br>
To prove yourself you can!  <br>

Don't talk to me about shit  <br>
If you don't have people in your life you need to prove wrong  <br>
Or someone you wake up thinking about every day  <br>
Don't tell me he has ambitions  <br>
If all he hopes is waiting for a favor someone else is going to give him.  <br>

I can talk to you about ambitions  <br>
Because I have all of that  <br>
Because I have pain to get rid off  <br>
Because I don't leave shit to destiny or god!  <br>
Because I wake up every day with a purpose  <br>
And that purpose has YOU written all over it!  <br>

This was written with anger  <br>
Anger at being replaced  <br>
Anger that I am not good enough  <br>
Anger because my motives are pure without hate  <br>
Anger because I give without expecting   <br>
And maybe I need to start expecting   <br>

Maybe I need to bleach my life of stains  <br>
Maybe I am fucking wrong  <br>
But I am sure of one thing  <br>
I am not even the shadow of who I was yesterday  <br>
And tomorrow, I will be greater than I have ever been  <br>

Because I need to prove people wrong  <br>
Because I know what being broke is  <br>
Because I know what pain is  <br>
Because I know how to love for real  <br>
Because I have slayed bigger dragons  <br>
And this one is just an underdeveloped lizard  <br>

And yes I am tired of losing  <br>
But losing is making me a better player  <br>
Yeah I am tired of no having the girl  <br>
But the girl surely never forgets me  <br>
Because I rather be a good adventure  <br>
Than the boring motherfucker she marries  <br>

Because crazy people like me go 100% all the time  <br>
We don't half ass anything  <br>
We love strong and for real  <br>
We ditch fake people and keep walking with our head high  <br>
Because we know we were the bigger ones  <br>
We know that those who did us wrong  <br>
Are sitting on an imaginary high horse.  <br>

We, the losers, have not a fake morale  <br>
We ask for forgiveness when we fuck up  <br>
And forgive even those who don’t deserve it  <br>
Because we are fucking Alta Gama   <br>
and the rest will cry when we reach the mountain top  <br>

Yeah I am angry and I have the right to be.<br>
and I am writing it because I have no one talk to <br>
No one that understands this shit I am going through <br>
But I do have a lot of people who say meaningless words <br>
“You will get over it” “Everything is going to be fine” fuck that! <br>

I want someone I can vent to <br>
I want someone to be to me what I am to too many people <br>
An ear that listens to your frustration <br>
Not an ear that talks shit!  <br>
I don't want words of motivation! I am motivated alright <br>

Why can't I have that?  Why the fuck not? <br>
Why do I love but don't get it back?  <br>
But I get hate, oh yeah, I get a fuck ton of that! <br>
Why am I a friend to many but alone right now? <br>
Fuck this life! I will change it or I will die in the process <br>

And In my tomb will be written <br>
Here lies another broken misunderstood soul <br>
That did his best and fucking lost <br>
Here lies Lucifer! Be aware! <br>
