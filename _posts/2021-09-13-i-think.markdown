I think of you when the rain falls <br>
When the leaves change their colors, I see you <br>
The blowing of the wind carries your name <br>
The clouds in the sky pain your smell <br>

Every word in a poem reads your name <br>
Pages in all my books bring your smell <br>
Random paintings on a wall turn into your face <br>
The intensity of you is gravity to my soul <br>
