![Howl’s moving Castle](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f7222cc11e15dc525c7cffc7409f48e9/tumblr_p27ij2bJeB1tymixzo1_1280.jpg) <br>

I know that we cannot be together  <br>
I know all the barriers that exist between us  <br>
I know that we see each other when possible  <br>
But I am asking you if you want to try it again.  <br>

I am asking you if I can have from you what you already have from me  <br>
I will never love anyone even close to how intensely I love you  <br>
I will never crave the lips of another woman like I crave yours  <br>
I will never enjoy the intimacy of another body like I do with yours.  <br>

What I am asking is, will I ever be to you what you are to me?  <br>
Will I ever be not only a beautiful memory but the benchmark you use  <br>
Will I ever be that man that you will never say no to  <br>
Will I ever be what you are to me?  <br>

Can we ever be Sophie and Howl?  <br>
Could we ever live our lives in a moving castle   <br>
You certainly have my heart  <br>
So could I ever become more than just the man you like?  <br>

> **Special note:** Tonight, watch Howl’s Moving Castle on HBO Max. <br>
