The love between us is not easy to break <br>
It is an iron forged in the flames of our bed <br>
A diamond solid and pure <br>
An unbreakable chain that hate cannot separate. <br>

I can see it in your eyes when they meet <br>
It can feel it in your warmth when we hug <br>
It touches me whole when we kiss <br>
A love so strong it is difficult to believe exists <br>
