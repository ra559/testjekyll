I cannot promise<br>
That loving me will be easy<br>
I cannot promise<br>
That my actions will change their mind<br>


All I can promise you<br>
Is that I will try<br>
That I will love you back<br>
With more intensity each passing day<br>


I can promise you that you will not be alone<br>
That I will stand there with you<br>
Strong like a mountain in a storm<br>
That life could try to defeat us but it won't <br>


I cannot prosime you that it will be smooth sailing<br>
It will be probably be a stormy sea of troubles<br>
But we will navigate it together<br>
We will come out stronger on the other side<br>


So what do you say?<br>
Do you dare to try? <br>
