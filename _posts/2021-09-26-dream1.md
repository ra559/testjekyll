There I was, in a wedding I am sure was mine <br>
I was wearing a blue suit and I felt older <br>
The ceremony was on a beach. It felt like Spain <br>
I could tell because of the Spanish accent of some of the guests. <br>

The place was decorated with white <br>
The flowers were purple orchids and roses <br>
I do not know who my bride is  <br>
Nor can I remember who it could possibly be. <br>

The audience was the strange part <br>
It was divided into 3. <br>
On the left there was my family <br>
The complete tree;  alive and dead. <br>

In the middle were every friend I ever had <br>
The loyal ones were in the back with a shining light <br>
The ones who betrayed me were in the from <br>
Their faces frowned every time we crossed eyes. <br>

In the right were each and every one of my sensual conquests <br>
Every woman I ever kissed or had sex with <br>
They were positioned at random <br>
Every time I look at them I remember what I did with them. <br>

But in that crowed I did not see you <br>
Every one of my exâ€™s were there except you <br>
I kept trying to find you in the crowd but I could not <br>
I saw your family but not you. <br>

My bride came and I could not see her face <br>
Her body was clear to me but I do not know this faceless woman <br>
Why am I marrying her? <br>
I said my bows and she said hers <br>
And out of a sudden, the wedding was over and I was standing in front of my own grave. <br>
