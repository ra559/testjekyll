I could show you a picture of her <br>
Yeah, yeah! I know what you are gonna say. <br>
"You can do much better"  <br>
"You will find someone else" <br>
"Man Fuck her! Do you bro!" <br>

You will probably say all of those things right? <br>
Well, I don't care what you say <br>
I want her and the heart wants what the hear wants <br>
Fuck reason! <br>

How about I show you a picture of us? <br>
In my eyes you will see my joy <br>
In my eyes you will see what loves looks like <br>
In my eyes you will see traces of you last kiss <br>


I remember our first kiss in the back of that movie theater <br>
I was not nervous but curious <br>
The way she kissed me got me hooked from day one <br>
The way she looks at me with questions yelling in her eyes <br>

So how the fuck do you expect me to believe all those lies <br>
The heart wants what the heart wants <br>
My body craves the sweet sensation of her perfume <br>
I miss smelling her neck and what follows after as well <br>

So no! I cannot do much better <br>
and No! I will not find someone else that does the same <br>
and No! My love won't give her up <br>
I will be here for her. When she needs me or when she does not<br>
