The wind whispered through the dark <br>
Empty trees. A warning of a lonely life <br>
A language hidden in nature <br>
With winter comes the dark <br>

The snow piles before my eyes <br>
The heat escapes through the wind pipes <br> 
The body is ice. The soul is an iceberg <br>
Lonely months to come without her <br>

I lit the last cigarette  <br>
The only warm thing inside me <br>
The smoke poisons the rest <br>
But something warm gives me an edge <br>
