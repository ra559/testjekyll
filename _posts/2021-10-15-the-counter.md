I see her walking naked in the kitchen <br>
She is sensual even when she is not trying <br>
She walks with passion in her steps <br>
She talks with love in her words <br>
She looks with desire in her eyes <br>
The desire for me! The desire for us! <br>

I walk silently towards her <br>
She is making a sandwich to replenish the energy lost <br>
I touch her gluts gently and hug her from behind <br>
I am naked too and ready for round two <br>
I kiss her neck and she lets a moan go <br>

She sits at the counter; white as coke! <br>
Kissing, talking gently and unintelligently <br>
Telling jokes and words that will never be forgotten <br>
Living a moment that while brief, remains eternal <br>

That counter has the stain of our love <br>
That white counter is no longer pure <br>
That counter will forever remember the day <br>
That she came by and never really left <br>
