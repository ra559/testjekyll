![her](https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/3840x2160/1740147-George-Orwell-Quote-The-smell-of-her-hair-the-taste-of-her-mouth.jpg)<br>
Her essence became his and she turned out to be all the things he ever hope to achieve <br>
She became his only reason to exist. She invaded his mind like a conqueror and occupied every thought of his. <br>
And when she left, he kept looking for her. <br>
Today he walks this life seeking that scent, craving those lips every second of his days <br>
He lives understanding she is everything that matters. His world, His universe, His galaxy <br>
Chloe is everything for Lucifer.<br>
