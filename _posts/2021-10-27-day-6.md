Good morning my queen <br>
I hope you had a restful night <br>
I hope that I invaded your dreams <br>
And made love to you one more time <br>
Today is the 6th day of that painful vacation you took  <br>
Away from me, I miss you every night <br>
I miss every morning kiss <br>
I miss waking up at at 6 <br>
To bring you a cup of coffee to Burger King <br>
Come back soon because here you left <br>
A big stubborn heart Palpitando por Ti.  <br>
