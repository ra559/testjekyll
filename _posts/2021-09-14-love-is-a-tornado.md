Love is like a tornado, <br>
It yanks you out of the floor  <br>
I gives you the ride of your life  <br>
It makes you feel high all the time  <br>
Those strong winds take hold of you <br>
They move you around like juice in a blender <br>
And you love the movement <br>
Those rapid pulls that shake you into pleasure <br>
Sometimes there is a small rain <br>
But it passes and you keep going with it <br>
 
But then it drops you somewhere new <br>
Somewhere cold and lonely <br>
Somewhere you donâ€™t want to be and never intended to be <br>
And the tornado disappears <br>
With it goes the good feeling <br>
The butterflies in your stomach <br>  
The pain of falling hard on the floor creeps in <br>
And now you have to find your way back <br>
**And some people never find the way back. <br>
**
