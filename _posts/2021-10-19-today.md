Today is a normal day <br>
I don't like normal days <br>
So I am going to make today extraordinary <br>
I will go to her job and kiss her <br>
I will think about making love to her all day <br>
Maybe I get to! Who knows <br>

Today will go by smooth if I see her <br>
So I will do whatever it takes to see her <br>
Yesterday was brutal but today won't be <br>
Because I will see her. I will kiss her <br>

Tomorrow I don't know  <br>
But today I am sure of me <br>
Today I will do what I need to do <br>
And that is to be with her even if it is for a second or two. <br>
