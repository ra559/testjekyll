I found that person <br>
That turns my heart on when I get a message <br>
Whose phone calls are always welcome <br>
That makes my life complete <br>

I found that person <br>
That I want to die with <br>
That I want to give my entire life to <br>
That I want to wake up to every morning <br>

I found that person <br>
That is worth all my energy <br>
That I can give all my time to <br>
That no matter what I will fight for <br>

I found you and I don't want anyone else. <br>
