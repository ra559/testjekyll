If you call me late at night <br>
I will be awake for you <br>
If you are coming home late from work <br>
I will be awake waiting in the cold room for you <br>

Tonight or tomorrow <br>
When you think is too late to text <br>
Never doubt me or yourself <br>
I will be awake. Waiting for the call or text <br>

I do not care for my sleep <br>
I do not care for anything else <br>
Because a moment with you <br>
Is worth everything I own and everything there is <br>

Inspiration? There is plenty of it <br>
You do not leave my head <br>
You do not leave my heart <br>
You do not leave because I will never push you away <br>

So will you come? <br>
