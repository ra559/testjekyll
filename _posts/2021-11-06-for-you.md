I will look for you <br>
In every pair of eyes that capture mine <br>
In every kiss I give <br>
In every new body I discover <br>
In every skin that meets mine <br>
In every encounter I have <br>

I will try to find in you in my dreams <br>
In deserted lands that mind creates <br>
In the cold nights where while in the company of others <br>
I feel the loneliest. <br>

I will try to feel you once again <br>
In the wind <br>
In the sea <br>
In the rivers <br>
That bring with them words of your wellbeing <br>

I will do all those things <br>
Because you mean the world to me <br>
You gave a universe of happiness <br>
When I was looking for an island of smiles. <br>

Chloe! You will never leave <br>
As long as I have you in me <br>
As long as the time keeps flowing <br>
So will my love increase for you. <br>

I will look for you <br>
I will feel you <br>
I will find you <br>
Because Lucifer loves you. <br>
