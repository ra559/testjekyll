From the dawn of the day, I think of you <br>
I gaze up to the sky as always blue <br>
I wish for those lips of yours just for a few <br>
And I wonder, have you been thinking the same too? <br>

We walked this morning and it brought me happiness again <br>
Like if an electric wire has been connected to my brain <br>
Your kisses in the morning are novocaine to my pain <br>
Any time I see you, in my soul, it stops the rain. <br>

We kissed while water wet our faces <br>
Everywhere we went. We kissed in all right places <br>
We ended our meet up in the car  <br>
With my fingers, in the middle of the day, I made you see the stars. <br>

Right after you left today <br>
I started missing your right away <br>
Because I never want to let you go <br>
I want to hold you tight. Right here with me. In my arms. <br>
