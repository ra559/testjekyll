Be free my love <br>
When you feel like the world is crumbling <br>
Come to me. <br>
I’ll ease your load <br>
Let your troubles fly <br>
Do not let them make you a slave <br>
Be free. Be you <br>

I am with you <br>
There is nothing to fear <br>
Not even fear itself <br>
You will always have me <br>
And in me a place to be <br>

Do not let a thing hold you back <br>
You only have one life <br>
Live it to its fullest
Don’t worry about mistakes <br>
They serve a purpose to teach us what not to do <br>
So be free <br>
Be loved <br>
Be with me <br>
