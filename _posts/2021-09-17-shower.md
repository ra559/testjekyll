She was late for work <br>
I came late from work last night <br>
My insomnia did not let me sleep <br>
I stared at her the rest of the night. <br>

When I heard the shower, I could not resist <br>
I entered slowly because the door was open <br>
She was a little surprised when I touched her elbow <br>
We have not showered together in months. <br>

The water was melting our bodies together <br>
I could feel the passion brewing while we kissed <br>
She no longer cares she was late <br>
Someone else will have to open the store today. <br>

My hands were rediscovering her body <br>
She felt unknown to me like the first day <br>
I do not know what is the deal with the shower <br>
But It made me want to love her harder than ever. <br>

I pressed her to the shower glass <br>
She let a small moan escape  <br>
I loved every minute of it <br>
This shower. This moment. May it never end. <br>
