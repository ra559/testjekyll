I choose to be with you <br>
Even if the conditions are endless <br>
I only see on option and it is you <br>

I choose to chase you <br>
If you go far away <br>
I will be right behind you in the trip <br>

I chose to be happy  <br>
And happy is means you <br>
While perfect means us <br>

I choose to stay <br>
To make it work not matter the cost <br>
As you are priceless and avobe all <br>

I choose to fight <br>
Whoever dares to get in the way <br>
will only fool themeselves thinking I will forget <br>

I choose to try <br>
To make you happy every day of my life <br>
The number one priority no matter what <br>

No matter options there is <br>
I choose you <br>
Regardless of the number of fish in the sea <br>
