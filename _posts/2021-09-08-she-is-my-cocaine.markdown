![mad kiss](https://c.tenor.com/oYho4qi9E7cAAAAM/sex-make-out.gif)<br>

Maybe she does not know that when it is foggy I write her name next to mine <br>
She probably does not know that a single one of her kisses gets me through the day<br>
I bet all I have that she does not even suspect that my heart runs crazy when she texts me<br>
Yeah. She does not know how crazy I am.<br>


She looks at me and I see an ocean of passion in her eyes<br>
But she does not know what I see<br>
What she knows is that I love her but not how much<br>
She does not believe but if she looks deep in my eyes she will find the proof<br>


If her kisses get me mad, imagine her breast?<br>
Imagine how much i lose myself when I smell her perfume in her neck?<br>
Image how crazy I get when I am eating her soul out?<br>
This is no joke. She is my cocaine<br>
