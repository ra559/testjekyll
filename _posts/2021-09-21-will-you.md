Lying in my bed every night I wonder <br>
Will you miss me when I am gone? <br>
Will you miss my naughty looks when we are alone? <br>
In your sleepless nights, will you remember our crazy talks? <br>

When a song plays, will you think of me? <br>
When those lyrics that spell our story come to your lips <br>
Will my face fill your mind? <br>
Will those lyrics trigger your memories of my touches? <br>

When you have your vodka drinks, will you remember those times <br>
Those nights when I was your personal bartender <br>
And when those close to you ask about me. <br>
Will you lie? <br>

I wonder above all, will you remember my love? <br>
Will you remember how insane I was? <br>
Will you remember that for me you are everything <br>
Will you remember how we made love. <br>
