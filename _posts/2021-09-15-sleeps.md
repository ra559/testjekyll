It makes me happy watching her sleep <br> 
Her hair smells like heaven if it exists <br>
Her skin is softer than silk and I cant resist <br>
To wake her with my touches and love her as is. <br>

May this moment last forever <br>
May this feeling become my endevour <br>
Knowing she exist makes me feel better <br>
She is my Sun. Of my universe its center <br>

I wonder what she dreams <br> 
Is it me? that is what it seems <br>
She smiles in her sleep <br>
I love the expression. I want to scream <br>
