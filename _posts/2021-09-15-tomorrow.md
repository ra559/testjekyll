Tomorrow will be another day <br>
My heart will swim again <br>
In an ocean of sorrow <br>
Where the sun of your lips <br>
Does not bless my morning <br>

It is the third day <br>
No seeing you feels like an eternity <br>
If hell is this I need to be a better Christian <br>
This is too painful. This last too long. <br>

I need to do something <br>
Maybe drop by your job <br> 
and while not being noticed <br>
Grasp a glimps of your smile <br>
