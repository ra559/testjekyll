If you were a drug <br>
you would be a dangerous mix <br>
a mix of cocaine, meth, an acid <br>
that somehow does not kill me <br>
but in return makes me better each day. <br>

This morning, after kissing you <br>
I remember that day when we were just getting to know each other <br>
when you made me empanadas at 5 am in the morning <br>
while I unloaded a truck of merchandise in that horrible job I had. <br>

It's funny how I remember random things like that <br>
specially when I see you  <br>
I think about everything I want to do to you <br>
Everything I want to do for you  <br>
And how little I care about the rest of the world <br>

And after we make love, <br>
that when the drug fact kicks in <br> 
I spend the day in nirvana <br>
nothing can ruin that day <br>
Everything is great, pain does not exist <br>
