First, I will get my own place <br>
Then I will work 100 times harder  look my best <br>
I already get a haircut every week <br>
I already order a watch to match my wrist <br>

I need to buy more shirts <br>
I need to dress better <br>
Maybe learn some Bachata along the way <br>
And lastly, I need to learn some sort of hand trade. <br>

I need to open a Facebook page <br>
I need to pretend to be happy with someone else <br>
Maybe have a kid or two and post pictures of them <br>
Then, and probably only then, she will see that breaking up was a mistake. <br>

I want her love again <br>
I want her with me and no one else <br>
I want us to make plans and travel everywhere <br>
I want to get old also next to her. <br>
