Here is a little detail that I enjoyed yesterday night <br>
I was having a difficult day and when I saw you I saw the light <br>
I was very tired and fell asleep very fast <br>
But when I touch your face my hands absorbed your smell <br>

I love how your skin smell <br>
It is so sweet it makes me go crazy <br>
I love staying close to you after our kiss <br>
I feel your scent getting inside me <br>

That is a small detail I start missing as soon as you leave <br>
It is intoxicating in a good way <br>
Because it makes me go crazy <br>
It fills my brain with all those good chemicals <br>

That is one of the reasons that I love seeing you <br>
That I go to all the lengths to see you even if it is for a minute <br>
Your soft skin is like being caressed with clouds <br>
Clouds that smell so sweet I want to die in them.  <br>
