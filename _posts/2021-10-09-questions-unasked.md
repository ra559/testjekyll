There are a million  questions I want to ask you. <br>
But I am afraid of the answer <br>
Because I know I failed you  <br>
And I know you have reasons to not want me <br>

But the answers will not make me better <br>
I tell you all the things I do because I feel them <br>
And before l leave this world <br>
I need you to know that a man here loves you <br>

I need you to hear all the things I feel <br>
Because I do not want to regret not saying them <br>
When I am old and dying I will only say <br>
I loved a woman that maybe loved me <br>

So i will not ask you those questions <br>
Because I do not want to upset you <br>
I just want to make you happy <br>
And I want you to be happy with me <br>

So let those words die unsaid <br>
Let those hugs be set <br>
And let your lips be mine again <br>
Agan and again lets make love! <br>
