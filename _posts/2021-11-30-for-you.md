There is not a thing I would not do for you <br>
I would fight a million wars <br>
I would change everything about me <br>
I would become muslim, christian or hindu <br>
I would build a million cities  <br>
And break them all down if you ask me to <br>
That is the kind of crazy I am <br>
The kind that would do anything that is required <br>
I lost you once <br>
And with that I lost everything that gave meaning to this life <br>
So I would do anything for you <br>
I would even try to forget you if you ask me to <br>
But that will fail as it is impossible to do <br>
Tell that to your mother when she asks about me <br>
Tell her that I am crazy about you <br>
And that would do anything for you and your kids. <br>
