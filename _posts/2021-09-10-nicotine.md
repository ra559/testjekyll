Nicotine and Caffeine keep me going <br>
We have thresome all day every day <br>
I know it is not a good convination <br>
But what can I say? I admire those who don't need them <br>

Nicotine takes me into action <br> 
It puts my depression at rest  <br>
She gives me all I need to live my day <br>
While it takes away another day of my life <br>

Caffeine is my cocaine <br>
I cannot live without her <br>
She tells me to the ear "Don't give up just yet" <br>
Another line of code, another poem or simply get out of bed <br>

I know this is not healthy <br>
But it is the best I got <br>
So until I am out of the hole <br>
Nicotine and Caffeine are my deadly lovers till the end <br>
