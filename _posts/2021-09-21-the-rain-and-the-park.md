[Cigarettes After Sex while raining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZNKSLyz5Vc)<br>

It was a Tuesday evening, 9:36 to be exact, she told me that it was raining. I like the rain as a matter of fact we both do. I told her that the rain is good for love and she asked me how so? I told her that it is good for making love and lose oneself with the water. She liked the idea so I drove to the park near her house. It was raining cats and dogs as if the heavens were about to fall. I was wearing my gym clothes so I did not care if I got wet or if she did not show. She has kids at the end of the day and they are always first as they should. <br>

I text her. She did not respond.  <br>
I called her private and she picked up after the 4th tone.  <br>
Hello? She said with a timid voice.  <br>
I’m here in the park waiting for my love. <br>

She came 15 minutes later wearing a dress <br>
She parked her car next to mine and gave me a call <br>
I told her I’m here by the banks next to the main court <br>
She walked by and the rain was making one of her body and her clothes. <br>

When I saw her my body reacted <br>
The cold I felt turned into heat under my pants <br>
I could not resist so I kissed her in a hurry just like that <br>
I pressed her body to the wall, hold both her hands, and kissed her neck. <br>

She let a little moan go and I got excited <br>
She hugged me right after because she was  cold <br>
I was not. She could tell by what’s happening in my pants <br>
I kissed her again aggressively this time. <br>

I put my leg between hers and I could feel the heat coming on <br>
The water dripping between her breast and my heads holding tight <br>
I took her underwear off and started a game with her and my hand <br>
She was losing her mind and I was in control. <br>

She knew she could not scream her ecstasy so she bit her lower lip <br>
The motion drove me to put my fingers inside <br>
She was moister than the water and hot as the fire of a stove <br>
I love provoking her body like this till she climaxes with my fingers alone. <br>


I could not resist the temptation of tasting her sex <br>
I will never deny that it is the most delicious of plates <br>
I never get tired of consuming her love <br>
And she never denies herself an opportunity to let me on. <br>

![kiss](https://c.tenor.com/rh2hypMkavgAAAAC/rain-kiss-davydoff.gif)<br>

I eat her soul out of her sex for the next 40 minutes <br>
I could no longer feel the rain <br>
It felt like the storm was gone <br>
But I knew better it was her numbing me to the cold. <br>


When I was done, her legs could not hold on <br>
We went to the car and the sound of the rain falling felt nice <br>
She got on top of me and rode me like she never had. <br>

She kissed me passionately for 5 minutes that froze time <br>
I turned her around with her legs each on a different side <br>
I love seeing her like that, 4 legs and a naked back <br>
I owned her right there like I do every time. <br>

The storm kept the sound of her moans muffled <br>
She noticed and never stop screaming her pleasure <br>
I love seeing her climax like that <br>
Nothing to hold back. Living every touch like the last. <br>

![sleep](https://c.tenor.com/12WKvg8xbGcAAAAC/cuddle-naked.gif)<br>

We felt asleep naked in the car <br>
The storm was too strong so no cops went by <br>
An hour passed and the sound of a phone called disturbed our peace <br>
Where are you? The voice on the receiver asked. <br>
I went for a walk in the rain to clear my mind. <br>

She hanged up the call and kissed me one last time <br>
She had to go and  to the call, I laugh <br>
I am Lucifer and she is mine <br>
This time and for eternity I will possess her leaving no trace behind. <br>
