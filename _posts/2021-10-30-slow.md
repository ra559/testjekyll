Take it slow. <br>
Don't rush it. <br>
Good things are meant to be enjoyed <br>

It's warm and gentle <br>
Sweet and tender <br>
The dance of four lips <br>
Burned forever in my memory <br>

Kiss me like that again <br>
And I will give you the world <br>
Kiss me like that again <br>
And bring me back to life <br>

Just like the morning coffee <br>
Enjoy me, <br>
Consume me, <br>
Kill me, <br>
with the softness they bring <br>
