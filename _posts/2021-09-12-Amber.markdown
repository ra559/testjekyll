How did you know? I asked, not sure I wanted the answer. <br>
I thought I had been careful. <br>
I thought she did not suspect <br>
But she did. Why her? She asked me with tears in her eyes 
I said nothing. <br>
My mind was going too fast to think of the right words. <br>
All these years I have not loved her a single day. <br>
Today, I see the realization in her eyes. <br>

I don’t hate her. She has given me everything in this life <br>
She has shown me that she loves me. <br>
Forgiven every infidelity. Raised my children and even get along with my mother <br>
But I could never love her. <br>

I have not seen R. in years. I have spoken to R. in years <br>
We hate each other or at least I know she hates me <br>
But Amber does not see it that way <br>
She has caught me seeing R pictures too many times in the past <br>

Today. She could not take any more. <br>
I will give her the divorse so she can find someone else
But she won't take it. <br>
God damn it, why doesn’t she give up on me? <br>

Why don't you leave me? I asked her with sadness in my eyes <br>
Because I love you. And I would rather be miserable with you than spend any second of my life with someone else. She said, <br>
That's the liquor talking. I said. <br>
She kissed me. We had sex. And we will have this conversation again. <br>
