We walked in that old bridge one more time <br>
The lightning was perfect and the air was cold <br>
I kissed her on the lips and my hands got warm <br>
I did not want to stop at any time. <br>

She got here first and I was driving by <br>
Like usual, I change my plans <br>
Because an opportunity to kiss those lips <br>
Is all I dream of and live by. <br>

It sounds foolish to throw everything away like that <br>
But what can I say in my defense? <br>
I am addicted to her. I Live for smelling her scent
Kissing those lips is all I have to look at! <br>

I did not want her to leave tonight <br>
So I dragged her to the little alley by the tennis racks <br>
And I pushed her to the fence and kiss her one more time <br>
This time, aggressively wishepring all the things I had in my mind. <br>

We said “see you later” like every time <br>
I jumped from the passenger sit to her car <br>
And kissed again; longer this time <br>
Because that is just the way I like to say goodbye. <br>
