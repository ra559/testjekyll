I never imagined the day I met her that I would fall <br>
I never predicted that I could love her the way I do <br>
I never thought that the passage of those years <br>
Would turn her into every reason that I have to live. <br>

She does not believe it of course <br>
She has someone else she can call <br>
Someone else that can tell her pretty words <br>
So why would she believe mine? <br>

I deserve everything I got  <br>
I did not deserve her and that is a fact <br>
But I will work until my last breath  <br>
To prove that I can become the man <br>
The man that can deserve her <br>
The man that she can love <br>

There won’t be a day that passes by <br>
Where I will not work to get better at that <br>
At that thing that I am lacking for her to love me <br>
I will become another animal <br>
I will show her with time <br>
That my love is real. That I never lied. <br>
