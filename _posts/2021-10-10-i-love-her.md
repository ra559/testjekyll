_And on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now <br>
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall <br>
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe <br>
Think I like you best when you're just with me <br>
And no one else_ <br>

[k.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4sbDxR22z4) - Cigarettes After Sex <br>

I love her.  <br>
In a way that is not healthy <br>
In a way that is going to kill me <br>
In a self destructive way <br>
In a beautiful way <br>

I love her in a way that hurts sometimes <br>
I love her in a way that makes me miss her in every breath I take <br>
I love her in a way I have never told any one <br>
I love her in a way that can barely be expressed in my poems. <br>

I don't know when I started loving her <br>
I cannot recall the minute I looked at her and she became my love <br>
I cannot remember the morning I woke up and she was my sun <br>
But I know I love her. That much is true <br>

So make fun of me all you want <br>
Call me a loser if that is want makes you laugh <br>
Call me a child, less of man, or immature at best <br>
But I know what love is and what it feels like. <br>

I know what pain is <br>
I know what it is like to lose someone forever while they are still alive <br>
I know what it feels like to know the woman you love is happy in other arms <br>
So one day, when you get to feel the same, call me and tell me how much of a child I am. <br>
