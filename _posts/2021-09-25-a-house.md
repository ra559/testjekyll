I can tell you a place where you are <br>
In my mind and my heart <br>
You came to visit once <br>
Over a pack of yellow M&Ms <br>
You liked the place too much and stayed. <br>

Sunny days came by and you smiled <br>
Gloomy days we survived <br>
The rain came and washed us away <br>
But here you build a house <br>
And the house remains. <br>

Storms tried to sweep it away <br>
But the house was strong and survived the wave <br>
So here you are living <br>
And the house you built <br>
In my mind and heart <br>
And every once in a while you take a vacation <br>
And you come by. <br>
