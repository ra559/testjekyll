You expect me to give up<br>
You want me to hate you<br>
You want me to stop loving you<br>
You want me to go away forever<br>

How do you expect me to do all of that?<br>
I can’t stop loving just because you say so<br>
How can I not love you if you are everything I look forward to?<br>
How do you expect me to hate? How insane is that?<br>

I will not stop.<br>
I may never see you again<br>
But don’t pretend I don’t love you anymore<br>
I will respect the boundaries you put<br>
And cry in silence in my little corner of the world<br>
But every morning when I wake up<br>
My heart will be beating for you<br>
And in every breath I take<br>
I will be hoping to hear from you<br>

I am sorry.
Whatever I did for you to make that decision<br>
I regret it a million times over<br>
But just remember<br>
Days will come and go<br>
But my love for your will simple grow strong <br>
