![your name](https://robertalberto.com/yourname.png)<br>
A long time ago a wrote a name on the sand <br>
It was a joke that I wanted to show you at that time <br>
I drew a heart around it and snap a pic of the art <br>
You laughed, liked it, and I enjoyed that smile. <br>

Today, I write your name in a tree <br>
Because the ocean was too quick <br>
It washed your name away <br>
But this tree will remain until the end of days. <br>

And every once in a while, I will come back to the tree <br>
To read your name at loud begging on  my knees <br>
And remembering that once upon a time I was your king <br>
And to the castle of my heart, your were its queen <br>

I saw the picture the other day and I cried <br>
I remembered that day well. Im telling no lies <br>
If I could relive it one more time <br>
I would write your name in a rock <br>
So it won't wash away no matter how hard itâ€™s stoked <br>
