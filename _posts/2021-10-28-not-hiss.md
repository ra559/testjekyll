He is lucky to have you <br>
But you are not his <br>
We belong to where we are loved the most <br>
And here, farway, there is a heart who beats for yours. <br>

He sees your smile and has no wonder <br>
Here, I admire every one of them <br>
Treat them as the most beautiful canvas <br>
Each one greater than the last. <br>

I miss everything from you <br>
He will miss your bed <br>
I miss every hair in your head <br>
Every word you say <br>
Every second with you <br>
I miss your essence, not just your sex <br>
