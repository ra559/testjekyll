There is this feeling I get when I drive to see you <br>
The closer I get to your place the more excited I am <br>
My hands become a nervous reck <br>
I cannot wait to get to the destination so I can see you <br>

I curse every traffic light <br>
I hate every slow driver that delays me <br>
And while we are only 15 minutes away <br>
The ride last too long for me to bare <br>

I get fidgety just thinking  <br>
that we are moments away from kissing again <br>
And those days when we are going to make love <br>
The entire day feels that way <br>
