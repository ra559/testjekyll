I swim in an ocean of minutes <br>
Down here everything is absolute <br>
The deeper I go, the darker it gets <br>
Day to day, I accumulate regrets. <br>

Out there in the distance I see a lighthouse <br>
I hope to reach the light before I drown <br>
Now I am swimming harder than before <br>
But the light keeps running away from the shore. <br>

Untouchable: always be out of reach <br>
In this vast ocean no one can see <br>
No one can hear me scream <br>
I am sinking. This is the end for me. <br>
