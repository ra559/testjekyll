Last night I slept a lot <br>
But it was not a good night <br>
**You escaped my dreams last night** <br>
I do not remember what I dreamed <br>
But it was not good <br>
Because you were not there. <br>

You make me whole <br>
Without you there is an essential piece of me missing <br>
Like a computer without a hard drive <br>
Living volatile without any care <br>
**Starting over every day because nothing is worth saving** <br>
That is my life in your absence. <br>

Every morning, as soon as I wake you <br>
Your name invades my mind <br>
**Your face takes over every thought** <br>
Your kisses are all I desire <br>
And only after I see you, I count the day as lived <br>

Every night, I miss the warm you bring <br>
I long for a good night message, call or gif <br>
**I really wish a good night kiss** <br>
A love making session every time we can <br>
Really, I miss myself when we were us <br>

*I fight for you <br>
I will fight till the very last day <br>
I will fight even if you start hating me <br>
I will fight for you even if the world turns its back to me <br>
I will move any mountain that stands between us. <br>*
Because you are my my world, my happiness, the place where I belong <br>
My Chloe, My love.  <br>
My eternal desire that burns inside me <br>

*With love - Lucifer*<br>
