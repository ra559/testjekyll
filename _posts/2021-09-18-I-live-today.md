I live today not tomorrow.<br>
Tomorrow is uncertain<br>
I could die tomorrow <br>
And I will die loving you<br>

I’d do anything to see 5 minutes<br>
Because that is all I have<br>
If I go tomorrow<br>
I'll leave knowing that I saw you for those 5 minutes<br>

I don't want regrets<br>
And If i dont fight for this love, <br>
I will regret it every minute of the day<br>
You are the only story in my life i will never be sorry for<br>

So love me, better yet love yourself with me<br>
Let’s make this movie together <br>
Because when I am old and tired<br>
I want to remember every kiss<br>
Every hug<br>
Every love session<br>
Every look<br>
Everything …<br>
