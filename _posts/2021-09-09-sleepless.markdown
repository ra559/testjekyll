Here is a verse from one of my favorite Soviet songs: <br>
<p></P>
"Those who got to bed, good night, good dreams<br>
I've been waiting for this time and here it is<br>
This time has come<br>
Those who are silent started to talk<br>
Those who've got nothing to wait, mount their horses<br>
You won't catch up with them, no, not now"<br>

I've never known what to make out of this song <br>
I can tell you how much of musical genius Tsoy was <br>
Sometimes, I feel the song is just about not sleeping long <br>
Other times, I feel is a goodbye with suicidal thoughts <br>

I go to bed every night <br>
But I barely sleep at times <br>
I forgot how to dream <br>
Not even melatonin could provoke the feels<br>

The second line trips me the most<br>
I have been waiting for a long time to sleep<br>
But everyday, I feel more and more like a ghost<br>
Even the days when I can, it's never deep<br>

The funny thing is that I used to sleep<br>
I used to dream all sort of things<br>
But ever since that horrid night<br>
My brain refuses rest and to the pain it clings<br>

I used to watch movies to go to bed<br>
Played a boring one and off I went<br>
I cant watch movies without her<br>
With her, she took my sleep, love, and my rest<br>

Not all hope is lost by the way<br>
I found an old friend that numbs the pain<br>
Those days where I need to kill the brain<br>
Vodka on the Rocks plays a tune and insomnia goes away.<br>
