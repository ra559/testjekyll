We made love passionately this afternoon <br>
We stared at each other at the end <br>
Magic! Magic happened in that holy hour <br>
Once again, she was mine and I gave in to her   <br>
 
Phone call …. <br> 
Caller: Don’t forget that I need shoes! <br> 
Her: Oh! Damn it! I forgot. Ok I’ll go get them <br>
 
She needs to leave <br> 
I don’t want her to go <br> 
Please stay, let’s cuddle, let’s do it again - I tell myself <br>
She looks at me and und erstands <br>
She knows what I want. <br> 
 
Moments later …  <br>
 
Her: Do you want to go with me? <br>
Me: I’ll go to hell and back if it is with you. <br>

I loved that hour we spend at the mall <br>
We walked everywhere looking for the shoes <br>
Honestly, I did not want to find them soon <br>
I wanted that hour to last as long as possible <br>

We went to the first store  <br>
But they did not have the shoes she was looking for <br>
So we went to a different store <br>
This one was in the mall. <br>

I hold her hand while we were walking  <br>
She took my hand without hesitation <br>
My heart jumped a little from such a gesture <br>
She got in the store and picked up a call. <br>

I went to another store to check on random things <br>
I did not want to speak and ruin the phone call <br>
When she was done I kissed her on her cheek <br>
We walked a little more. <br>

We got food because we were hungry <br>
The lovemaking of earlier depleted our energy supply <br>
I enjoyed looking at her eating more than my food <br>
When it comes to making her happy, I’ll do whatever I can. <br>

We had to go to a different mall <br>
I was not angry about that <br>
The more time I have with my love <br>
Well, the happier I am. <br>

In this new place, we found what we were looking for <br>
I was a little sad because the time for her to go was coming fast <br>
I enjoyed every second of the drive back <br>
And when she dropped me off I did not want to get out of the car. <br>

But I had to let her go <br>
For she had things to attend <br>
And if she never leaves <br>
Then she can never come back to me. <br>
