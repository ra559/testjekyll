I want to write book <br>
A special one about us <br>
A book that describes our pain <br>
A book that draws our love <br>

The book will have everything I hate <br>
This distance between, this impossibility of not having you <br>
It will cry the suffering I canâ€™t <br>
It will paint us in the image of the reader <br>

The story will tell how we don't watch movies anymore <br>
How I miss you next to me in every single scene <br>
How I talked about the songs in the soundtrack <br>
And would just look at me like I am crazy <br>
  
Maybe if I write it you will read it <br>
Maybe you will read the dedication page <br>
And you see that there is only one line <br>
To my queen from her crazy lover! <br>
