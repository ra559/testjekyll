I am not kidding <br>
When I tell you that you are the most beautiful woman <br>
I know you may not believe it <br>
But that is what I see <br>

You have the most charming smile <br>
Because that is the smile that makes me feel <br>
It brings warmth to my cold life <br>
It brings the light that I long for <br>

I will spend my whole life telling you this <br>
You my Chloe are the most beautiful <br>
The most charming <br>
The sexiest <br>
You are simply the best <br>

You have no match  <br>
And there is no way I can convince myself otherwise <br>
I cannot lie to myself and pretend you are not <br>
You are the most beautiful gem in my eyes <br>

The most precious metal <br>
The shiniest star <br>
The brightest moon <br>
The bluest sky <br>
