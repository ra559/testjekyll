Tell them what you feel <br>
Life is only one <br>
There is no guarantee of a second one <br>
So if you love someone tell them that you do <br>

What is the worst that can happen? <br>
If you don’t say it, you will regret it <br>
In your last days in this earth, <br>
You will remember their name <br>
You will remember how much of a coward you were <br>
Because you were not honest enough to tell them <br>
That you love them <br>
That you wish you could have made it work. <br>

Try it! <br>
Over and over again until it can’t no longer work <br>
Because it is better to love someone till the end <br>
Than giving up just for a reason you know very well is an excuse <br>

Pride is a useless thing <br>
It will only get you from pain to pain nonstop <br>
Humble yourself to admit that you fucked up <br>
That you made a mistake and that you are sorry <br>
But don't stop there.  <br>
Show them that you want to fix things <br>
Because words need to be followed by action <br>
Being sorry is never enough when you love someone. <br>

Seek for that opportunity to show them <br>
That you don't want them to leave <br>
That you want them to stay <br>
Because it is better to try and fail <br>
Than regretting not trying at all in your deathbed <br>

So if you ask me why do I do the things I do <br>
It is simply because I love you <br>
And I will rather fail at getting another chance with you <br>
Than not trying at all <br>
Because at the end of my days, I will tell those around me <br>
I loved Chloe with all my heart and with all my will <br>
I begged Chloe for a chance over and over and I don't regret it <br>
I became better and reinvented myself <br>
Because she was worth it <br>
She made me better when I was with her <br>
And kept making me better after I lost her <br>

Everyone around me will know that I loved you <br>
That the years did nothing but solidify what I feel for you <br>
Because when I love, I love 100% <br>
And If after reading this you decide to call it quits <br>
Know this at least <br>
I will keep on trying! <br>
I will keep on loving you! <br>
I will keep improving and becoming the man that deserves another chance with you <br>
I will search for you everywhere <br>
Because at least I know what happiness feels like <br>
And my happiness feels like you <br>
 <br>
