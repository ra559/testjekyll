I want to have you next to me in my bed <br>
No talking! Just whispering sweet words <br>
Mumbling nonsense every once in a while <br>
Telling each other the things we love and hate <br>

I want to have you next to me when I wake up <br>
Drink that sweet coffee you make <br>
Get the energy your kisses give me <br>
Enjoy your early eyes and words <br>

I want to hear the good mornings as well as the good nights <br>
I want to hear your laugh on the phone with Tick Tock <br>
I want to lay in your bed and do nothing <br>
Simply I want you back. <br>
