_**Him:** So what are we doing tonight? <br>
**Her:** I don't know. I'm hungry. <br>
**Him:** What do you want to eat? <br>
**Her:** We have the gift card for the Chinese place you like <br>
**Him:** I'll see you at 8. <br>_

…. <br>
 <br>
It’s been a while since we ate out <br>
Its been even longer since we had chinese <br>
We arrived to the restaurant the hostess was hot <br>
She looked at me curiously and I looked back <br>

She noticed what I did and she grinned in disapproval <br>
I could tell got a little jealous. She tries to hide it but I can tell <br>
She did not mentioned it at all but stayed quiet for at least 30 minutes <br>
I asked her about her day and it got the conversation going <br>

I ordered the beef and she got the shrimp <br>
We flirted while we ate. We were having fun <br>
I asked her where she wanted to go next  <br>
I noticed she wanted to feel me as much as I wanted to feel her. <br>

When we left the restaurant we went for walk <br>
We strolled around the parking lot by my apartment for awhile <br>
She was in a rush. I knew she had to pick her daughter up in an hour or so <br>
So I did not lose a minute more and got her in the back of the car. <br>

I kissed her furiously because I missed her a lot <br>
I could feel her getting warm and turned on <br>
She was wearing a dress which I loved <br>
I touched her breast and she complained but not so much <br>

We kissed a lot more and did not want to take it slow <br>
I knew that that was upon me and she needed to go <br>
I touched her sex. Her panties already wet <br>
I took her underwear off because I wanted dessert. <br>

I will leave the rest to your imagination <br>
But this much I will tell <br>
I kissed everything in her even her soul <br>
I made her mine one more time in place as rare as this lot. <br>
