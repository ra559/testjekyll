Who says I miss you? <br>
I don't miss you. <br>
Why Would I miss you? <br>
 
Who says that I miss your goodbye kisses? <br>
Who says that that I wait in solitude for your replies? <br>
Who says that I veil the death of your "Papi ya me voy!"? <br>
 
Who is the one spreading those rumors? <br>
Who is the one saying that I am dying inside? <br>
Who, please tell me who? <br>

Because, they are wrong. <br>
They don't know. They will never know <br>
I will never tell them the Truth <br>
The Truth is only ours <br>

Do I miss you? Who cares?<br>
Do I have your love? No<br>
Did we lost each other? Yes<br>
Would we find each other? Maybe<br>

Maybe one day, on the pages of a lost book<br>
You will read my name and I will read yours<br>
And the memories will live again in your look<br>
And only then, we will regret how it took.<br>
