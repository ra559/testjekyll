I did not see her today. <br>
Is this how the rest of my life is going to be? <br>
It feels empty. <br>
It feels like if I did not live today <br>
I could scratch this day off my life and it will not make a difference <br>
Did she miss me? Does not matter <br>
I miss her a lot. <br>

Maybe I will see her before the end of the week <br>
Maybe I won’t see her ever again <br>
But if I won’t, what will I do then? <br>
How am I going to continue? <br>
She did not leave my head all day <br>
What is going to happen when I am gone? <br>

This feeling is too strong <br>
I cannot fight this love <br>
It is a war I already lost <br>
It is a reality I don’t want to see anymore. <br>
