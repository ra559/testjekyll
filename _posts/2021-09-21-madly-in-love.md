It is how my heart stops when the music stop playing<br>
I think is call coming for you and I get excited<br>
Or how my brain associates every notification with a text from you<br>
That’s how madly in love with you I am.<br>

It is the thought of provoking a smile in your face<br>
Make you climax or get you excited with my words<br>
The thought of me being the cause<br>
That’s how madly in love with you I am.<br>

Do you see it?<br>
Do you feel it?<br>
What else should I do to show?<br>
That three is or will be another like you.<br>

It is how I miss your smell on these lonely nights<br>
How my skin misses yours right after you leave<br>
How I start planning the next outing just seconds after seeing you<br>
Or the many excuses I give to go visit.<br>

Woman! you are the one for me<br>
I will never stop this<br>
You will need to kill me<br>
This love won’t end. Get used to it!<br>
