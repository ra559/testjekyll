So I do a lot of crazy things <br>
What can I say for myself? <br>
I have never been normal <br>
I suffer from overanalyzing <br>

I am not perfect
And I see perfection as an impossibility <br>
But everything I do is with a purpose <br>
For instance, my purpose in life is you <br>

So I do crazy things for you <br>
But those things are only crazy for those who do not understand <br>
They are only crazy for those who cannot see <br>
Than life is not that simple <br>
That love is too complex <br>

Yeah, I may be nihilistic <br>
Yeah I may see things with sad eyes <br>
But I face reality for what it is  <br>
And I never run away from pain out of fear <br>

So that is me <br>
A crazy man in love with you <br>
I make mistakes <br>
But I do not stop at saying sorry <br>
I understand that words need actions to mean anything <br>
So I want to show you and the world <br>
That you are everything to me <br>
And losing you was the worst mistake I ever made. <br>

With crrazines and love <br>
Lucifer <br>
