An addict needs his kick <br>
And my addiction are those lips <br>
I would sell anything just to see <br>
I would suffer anything to experience that bliss. <br>

My day could be gray <br>
Sad and gloomy as the rain of May <br>
But kissing those lips take it all go away <br>
Like magic! It always brightens my day. <br>

That’s why if you as me <br>
I seek your company as it should be <br>
Because one day on my knees <br>
I’ll ask you to give me of your heart the key. <br>
