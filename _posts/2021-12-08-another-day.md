Any day is another day
There is nothing special about any day
Except those days I see you

Those days are my treasure
Thats I why I take so many pictures
Us together is priceless to me

So I do whatever I need to do
To see you one more time
Specially in the morning so my day can start

Another day is any day
Unless it is one of those days
When you bless me with a kiss

Maybe tomorrow wont be another day.
