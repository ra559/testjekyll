Our eyes met in the rearview mirror  <br>
The girl on the van had a cigarette in her hand <br>
And a waterfall of  tears in her eyes <br>
Her hair was straight, long, and black. <br>

The traffic light last an eternity  <br>
We looked at each other the whole time <br>
We found likeness in our looks <br>
She found sadness in me and I read her like a book. <br>

The light turned and I was going left <br>
To my misery, she was turning right <br>
I wish I could have told her <br>
It will be fine. You will come out stronger on the other side. <br>
