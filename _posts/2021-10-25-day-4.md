Today is a great day <br>
Today was born the love of my life <br>
Today will always be the best day of the year <br>
Today, even though she is away from me, I celebrate her day. <br>

I want the best for her! <br>
Happy birthday to the most beautiful woman in the world <br>
Today I will play all your favorite songs on repeat <br>
And even though she are far away <br>
I want the world to know that she is in my head today, tomorrow and forever. <br>

So every drink I take is on her name <br>
Every song I sing is with her on my thoughts <br>
Today! Simply the best day ever because it is her birthday <br>

I hope she is having fun today <br>
I hope she does something exciting <br>
I hope she smiles all day <br>
I hope a single negative thought occupies her day <br>
And if I don't see her today, then away and in silence, Happy Birthday Chloe. <br>
