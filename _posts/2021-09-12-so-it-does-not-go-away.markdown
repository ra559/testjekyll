You are saying the pain does not go away? <br>
No. It does not. Everything will remind you of her <br>
The scarf of the girl next door <br>
The coffee you picked up this morning <br>

You will get numb to the pain <br>
But it will remain. It's like a migraine <br>
You can take drugs and feel better today <br>
But the perfume of the next girl, will remind you of her <br>
 
Same goes for you. <br>
He will buy you flowers and you will remember that morning we made love <br>
He will call you and his good nights will remind you of me <br>
He wonâ€™t be your TDLMR but you will not forget <br>

He will do everything but nothing will remind you of me <br>
She will do nothing and everything will remind me of you <br>
Nothing will happen and we will dream of each other <br>
Because we are eternal and our random smiles will remind us of that. <br>
