We tend to believe that when **love is lost** <br>
We miss the sex or **the naughty touches** the most <br>
And while it is true that those things are **core to the pain** <br>
It is certainly not the case when we talk about **what we really want back.** <br>

To me, it is **those nights drinking** and listening to music in your room <br>
The sex was always better once our bodies were **intoxicated with the songs** <br>
To me, it is **the weird conversations** over the meaning of a song <br>
The pouring of your next drink. **The broken sentences** once we were too drunk. <br>

It is not the bed I miss, but **the sound you make when you sleep** <br>
When I say I want you back, **I am not saying** that I want to own you <br>
**I am saying** that I want to be happy again <br>
That **I want to see you** making some platanos con salami one more time. <br>

I am saying that **I want** to go shopping together again <br>
Plan for a lasagna that **you will make** <br>
Go to **buy beer** together to ShopRite <br>
Or simply going to Walgreens **with you** in your Ban. <br>

When I say that **I love you**, I am not trying to be funny or romantic <br>
**I am saying** that I accept you for who you are with your wins and loses <br>
**I am saying** that I want a life where I wake up with your smell impregnated in my skin <br>
**I am saying** that while I know there is nothing I can do, I will still try to do anything I can to be with you. <br>

When I tell you that **I miss you** <br>
**I am not lying**. I am simply telling you how empty my life is without you <br>
When I tell you that **I will never love again** <br>
_I am telling you that **my heart is yours** today and will never belong to anyone else._ <br>
