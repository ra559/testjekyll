I got some coffee at the Burger King where my love works, she wasn’t there I wonder where she could be. I called her but she doesn’t answer my heart is pounding thinking the she might be with someone else. <br>

My phone is dying, and my car too and I’m stuck in an abandon road in the middle of no where, I see car coming it was my love that was following me. It’s late and dark and we see a old cabin. Where we would spend the night <br>



In that cabin we talked about us. We cried together and then we made love. That kind of love that binds two souls like metal melting in a pot. She became my lover I became hers. The moment last an eternity and we were reborn. The rain hit the roof and we could hear every drop. I navigated her naked body like a lost child in a park. Every inch was new land, Every kiss a new ocean and in every touch I lost more of me and gained more of her. <br>

We didn’t say goodbye the next day because we wanted to remember that night like if it would never ended, saying goodbye would have meant that it was over and we didn’t want that to happen. <br>

Next we both called our so called partners. Those two who we don't love but have to be with. They don't understand us because only we understand each other. They don't know that the flame of this love consumes all shame and pain. They will never know that while we die with them, we rebirth with each other in this clandestine adventure we call life! <br>
