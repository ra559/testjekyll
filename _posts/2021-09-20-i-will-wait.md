At the end of the road <br>
When there is nothing left <br>
When all the rain falls <br>
All the snow melts <br>
I will be waiting for you. <br>

You can go to bed  <br>
And when you wake up, I'll be there for you <br>
You can go to work <br>
And when you come home, with a smile, I'll be here for you. <br>

When you call <br>
I will always pick up <br>
When you text <br>
I will text back <br>
Because in my life there is only you. <br>

When you go on a trip <br>
And my name is the furthest thing <br>
Your will be in my mind <br>
Because when you come back,  <br>
I'll be here waiting for you <br>
