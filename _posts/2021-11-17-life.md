Life is the hardest version of any shoot em up arcade <br>
At times you feel that there are projectiles coming from every direction <br>
So many enemies on the screen that you do not know what to do <br>
But then comes that nice power-up that clears the screen <br>
And before you know it, the stage is clear and the next level is up <br>

The thing is that the next level is always harder <br>
And sometimes you gotta lose a couple of times <br>
Before you can get the hang of it <br>
But once you figure out the trick <br>
The level feels like child’s play and you beat it in a heart bit <br>

If life is difficult now <br>
Congratulations! I have reached a new level <br>
But don’t worry, you will pick up a new power-up <br>
Maybe a new gun or just some extra coins <br>
Sometimes even an extra life <br>
Because you made it this far, and you will beat this level as well <br>

Don’t worry about the boss either <br>
It may look tough and overpowered 
But like the previous one, it also has its weakness <br>
And sooner or later you will discover it and defeat it as well <br>

But what makes life such a difficult game <br>
Is the fact that it has no manual <br>
No cheat codes <br>
No extra turns and no guide you can lookup <br>
What makes it so hard, is that you only have one coin <br>
And gotta last you a lifetime. <br>
