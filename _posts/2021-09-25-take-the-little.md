And I guess I knew she would have said no <br>
So I never called when I needed to hear her voice <br>
I preferred to take the little she gives; stand the noise <br>
Sustain the pain when you don’t have a choice. <br>

I rather go to sleep than getting her annoyed <br>
If I drive by to hear yelling at the boys <br>
They would respond “It’s Saturday mom!” <br>
She will drink some Jack with ice. Her favorite bomb. <br>

And I will stay home. <br>
In this horrid place alone <br>
I will think of her touches <br>
Thinking of us; imagining she loves it. <br>

Maybe she will read this maybe she wont <br>
tomorrow She will ask me question <br>
To which answers I have none <br>
But I don't have them tonight either! What a show!  <br>
 
I am terrified of the man I have become  <br>
A souless asshole who does not give a fuck <br>
Living every day to the fullest looking for her love <br>
Because without her, what fuck sense does anything make at all. <br>
