I walk this lonely road<br>
In this desert public park <br>
I feel like an alien in mars<br>
I don't know where I am<br>

This road feels like sand<br>
Every step is delayed<br>
Every thought comes in slow motion<br>
I'm drunk. I'm lost. Come find me<br>

I think I am going in circles<br>
This is the fifth time i see that oak tree<br>
Maybe it is not.<br>
Hello sir? A voice called<br>

Have we met? I said.<br>
No. But you seem lost. The voice whispered.<br>
I turned and there is no one<br>
Where am I? What is this place?<br>
