It is so easy to say to someone “You need to move on” <br>
When the other person does not understand that a cripple cannot walk <br>
It is so easy to say “You will find someone else” <br>
When in your eyes that person is perfect without a single flaw <br>
Moreover, their flaws make them that unique and beautiful <br>

People tell the lovesick all the time absurd shit like that <br>
They do it because it is always easier to lie <br>
Those people know that lovesickness has no cure <br>
Ask them what they feel when they see the one they love get away? <br>
Ask them if the bright memories come back? <br>
They will lie to you because they will never admit <br>
That they never stopped loving <br>

So why don't people simply tell the truth? <br>
Tell them that they will simply become numb to the pain <br>
That it will really never go away. <br>
They will simply continue on living and loving in secret <br>
Those “I love you” will go unsaid <br>
Those kisses will banish with the wind <br>
And in their bed days, they will always regret the love they never fought for. <br>
