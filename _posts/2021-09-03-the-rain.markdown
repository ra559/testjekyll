I wrote this about a week ago <br>
When my heart was in a darker place <br>
So I apologize for my tone <br>
This days I am mess or simply just a nut case. <br>

It was raining when i woke up <br>
Things are not different here <br>
I should fire the alarm clock <br>
I did not dream of you or me or anything at all <br>

Is this me being love sick? <br>
When will I hate you? <br>
When will your memory deplete? <br>
Everywhere i look, everything i do is you <br>

I feel pathetic writing this <br>
Because i know these letters your eyes will never read <br>
I wish my heart could be as cold <br>
As the rain that this morning falls <br>
