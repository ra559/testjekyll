Let's do it like there is no tomorrow <br>
Let's forget the past for an instance <br>
Let's lose each other and ditch the sorrow <br>
Let's find peace once again without resistance <br>

Let me swim in the warm ocean of your breast <br>
I want to fuck you non stop till the very end <br>
Let me find your point of ecstasy like I know best <br>
Let's climax together till our souls hang in suspense <br>

I can tell you all the things I'd do to you <br>
But I rather show you once you are naked with me <br>
That imagination is only foreplay to let the passion loose <br>
This time the lust will take control and we will be free <br>
