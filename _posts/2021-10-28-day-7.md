I can't take this any more <br>
This distance between us is a cancer <br>
I want the cure! I want you to come back <br>
I don't know if you want to come back or not <br>
But I am dying without listening to that sweet voice  <br>
I want to see your face one more time <br>
I want to kiss those lips and never stop <br>
I want to whisper in your ear “I missed you, Don't let me go” <br>
My days don't start right if don't have your good mornings <br>
My week is thrash if I don't get to make love to you <br>
So don't delay this any more and come back to my life <br>
Love you! Lucifer. <br>
