Tell me how. <br>
How can I make her see that her kisses are the sweetest <br>
That her lips have this nectar I cannot get enough of <br>
That she is perfection incarnate <br>
That her skin is the softest <br>
That my body has never met another with the same rhythm. <br>

I would give her whatever she wants <br>
If I do not have it, I’ll overwork to obtain it <br>
If she wants distance, with pain in my heart I will give it to her <br>
Because I want her to see herself through the eyes I see her <br>

Chloe is perfect <br>
But somehow she thinks she is not <br>
How can she not be? <br>
She makes me better every day <br>
The fact that she is in my life, makes it worth it every morning <br>

Everyday, I long to see her <br>
To smell her perfume one more time <br>
If she tells me she wants me <br>
I go, I do, I find a way <br>
Because there is no stopping this I feel for her. <br>

Tell me how. <br>
How can I make her understand <br>
That her sex is the most delicious and exotic flavor I’ve ever tasted <br>
That when she says she is coming over <br>
I am the happiest being ever  <br>
That I look forward so much <br>
That I can barely sleep the night before. <br>

It is like driving at a very high speed <br>
Kissing her, I am driving the deserted road of her body <br>
I always want crash and die in her <br>
Because a kiss brings me back every time. <br>
