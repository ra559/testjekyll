I looked at the barista and she gave me a playful smile <br>
Large or medium? She asked <br>
Large please. How is your morning today? I said returning the smile <br>
She seems fine and happy and simply said “very well thanks” <br>

Our eyes met once again  <br>
I dismissed it and open my phone <br>
I had a message from her <br>
I read the message and the barista talked again. <br>

I'm sorry, I was distracted. What was that? I asked <br>
Would you like milk and sugar. She said <br>
No. Just a large coffee black. <br>
Also another coffee large with 4 creams and 6 sugars. <br>

The barista, which name I still don't know, game a coquette gesture <br>
Isn't that a bit too much to add?  <br>
No. 4 creams and 6 sugars is perfect. <br>
4 creams and 6 sugars is how she prefers her coffee. <br>
