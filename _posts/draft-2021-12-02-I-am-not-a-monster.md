I am not a monster
<br>
<br>
This is  a letter to a woman that hates me.
<br>
<br>
I do not know what is the root of your hate. I have been good to you and your family. I love your daughter more than I love myself. I would die and live for her. And I adore her children despite the fact that they are not mine. I never cared for that. From the moment I saw them, all I wanted was to see them succeed. See them become the kings I could never be. See them achieve greatness in life and happiness as a whole. The happiest moments of my life were when they would refer to me as father or step-dad when talking to their friends. In those moments, my heart wanted to leave my body and come back. So how can someone like this be a monster? 
<br>
<br>
In the times when you needed me, I never said no. I always offered my helping hand even when I could not. I made the time. I lied and said no to other people so I can be available to you. I even defied my own family for your sake. I always tried my best to communicate with you. But you never tried. You never cared because your cognitive dissonance was more important to you. I do not hate you. As a matter of fact, I forgive you for breaking me like this. I forgive you for what you have done to me. Because despite my atheism, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in changes, in humanity, in being a good person even to those who hurt you without disregard.
<br>
<br>
It pains me to know that in your eyes I am as close to the devil as someone can be. I never put my hands on your daughter. I am not a violent person. But everytime she lost consciousness, I made sure to be in all my senses in case she needed me. I stopped getting drunk in your house because I wanted someone to be sober in case something bad happened. I did it for the sake of your grandchildren because they deserved a father that could make those sacrifices. Considering that their biological father  never lifted a finger for them. I am willing to lift the whole world and your daughter is a witness to that love.  I love them. And I love your daughter too. But you are full of hate and that does not let you see behind the curtain you have built for yourself. 
<br>
<br>
How can you call yourself a God believer? Does your god condone that hate you live with? Or is it your belief that shields you from being a good human being. Because a good human being is respectful of others. A good human being understands that we are not perfect and that we make mistakes. You more than anyone else should know this, as you are old enough to have seen people around you make terrible mistakes. And yet, I am not. Somehow, I need to be perfect right? This is not a rant but an examination of how much of a hypocrite you have been to me. How can you sleep well at night knowing that you have caused so much pain to other people? I would not be able to close my eyes in peace if I ever cause this much pain to someone else.
<br>
<br>
How could you even think that I raped a dog? What kind of person thinks that about a man you have met for so many years? Don't you think that if I had done anything to that dog there would have been traces everywhere? Blood and bruises and incredible agonizing pain? How far-fetched is your imagination to even think something like that? What is wrong with you? All my life I have owned dogs. I feel a deep attachment to them because they are dear to me. I have never mistreated an animal in my whole life. I guess that is another area where this atheist is a better christian than you. 
<br>
<br>
I did not want Jenny to buy a dog because I knew it would cause problems with you. Yet you blamed me for something I had nothing to do with, because for you, I am the root of all evil. The old serpent made man. Yet I am a man that is not afraid of loving. A forgiving person who took on 3 children that were not his. Who dared to love you and your daughter knowing that in doing such I will never have a family with my own blood. But I took the risk anyway and I accepted everything that came with it. I was happy with Jenny. She is my whole world and the only woman that completes me. That is why to me, giving away having children of my own was a fair price to pay. Besides I love Angel and Deivi as if they were my own. 
<br>
<br>

I am writing this letter with a pain that is killing my heart. Knowing that no matter what I do, you will always be a wall I cannot cross. It does not matter how much Jenny and I love each other, you are too selfish to put away your preconceived notions. Notions that do not even make sense or are correct. You hate me because of who I am. You hate me because of things I have achieved in so little time. You hate me because I do not give up. You hate me because I dare to be ambitious. In all honesty, you have no reason to hate me. You just like to hate me because somehow that plays into your games. And I wish I knew what your goal is. Why does it cause you pleasure to see me in agony? 
<br>
<br>
When your own son needed assistance to fix his fuck ups. I helped you because I understand how difficult this life is. And I understand that he had a difficult life. I did not hesitate to help him because as humans we are in this world to help each other. When you had no one else to go to, who did you call? Who was the only person who did not treat you like a child and understood your mental turmoil? That's right, it was me. I understood you and helped you. But, that does not matter right? Because I am the devil am I not? And this is not me throwing favors in your face, no it is not. This is me showing you how much of a hypocrite you are. Calling yourself a loving christian but laying out lies as big as the ones I mentioned here. How convenient it is to hurt people and then cry out god forgive me?! 
<br>
<br>
I made my share of mistakes. But I always apologize to you. That day I used the F word on the kids. I apologized to you right away because I crossed the line. I have never heard an apology from you because you are too proud to admit that you are a hateful person. I do not understand you. I am not catholic. But I try my best to get along. Change whatever needs to change because I believe in communication. I can get along with anyone provided they make the minimal effort. But you never did such a thing. You are set in your own ways. For you, the only way of living is your own and no one else’s to a point that you think your daughter has the mark of the beast for simply having a tattoo. I try to understand your world view but you never tried to understand mine. 
<br>
<br>
Do you think you are the only person who has gone through difficult times? Everyone has. But that does not give you the right to treat other people like garbage. You say you do not get in the middle of your daughter’s love life but that is a lie since the only people you are willing to accept are those who see the world how you see it. Somehow for you, any man is a good match for your daughter providing they have the same belief as you. It does not matter how little they can provide for your grandchildren or how much behind in life they are. If they believe the same as you, they are perfect in your eyes. No wonder why you want her to give Carlos a second chance. But the truth of the matter is that life is about sacrifices and making compromises. If you cared about your daughter’s happiness, you would not get in the way and manipulate your own desires into the mix. But you do not care about that. You want things to be done your way and your way only. Otherwise, you start with your little games of threatening to leave or kill yourself. Please tell me how that is not a manipulation tactic? Leave Adrian or I leave you! Leave Adrian or I kill myself! Really? Are those the actions of a mature person or the actions of a manipulative person? You tell me.
<br>
<br>
You accuse me a lot of evil things without any evidence. I should be angry and hateful towards you but I am not because I think you do this out of lack of knowledge. You do not know me. You have never bothered to have a simple conversation with me. A mature person would face their difference in dialog but you invent lies instead. You then believe those lies and feed them to other people as truth. What is wrong with you? Grow up! I speak my differences because I look for compromise and resolution. For forgiveness amidst all grief. For love instead of hate. I accept you as you are because you are part of the woman I love. But you cannot even give me a chance to talk! I am willing to move any mountain necessary. To admit my feelings and improve upon them. To provide all I have for those kids and your daughter but you cannot even give me a conversation? That is the least you could do. But what do you do instead? Run away! 
<br>
<br>
I have treated you with all the decency a person could expect. But you have treated me like a bastard. How fair is that? How would you feel if someone gave you the treatment you have given me? It is obvious that your daughter loves me and I know you see that. But since I am not a perfect christian that accepts all your superstitions, I cannot be the right man right? Because I need to be perfect while Carlos can be an abusive, insecure, unmotivated, underachiever alcoholic and that is fine! What a circus you have in your head. And I do not like talking about other men because I have my failings too. But the obvious do not need any clarifications.  
<br>
<br>
I know this will never reach you but with love, compassion, and hope that one that you let this hate go. Robert Alberto. The man that loves your daughter to death and will spend whatever time I need, to show her everyday how much of a precious gem she is to me.
