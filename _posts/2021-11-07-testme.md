You know i'll do it! <br>
Tell me where and how <br>
Go ahead test me however you like <br>
I am not afraid to fail <br>

I am not afraid to lose <br>
I am not afraid to win <br>
I am afraid of the day when you don't love me anymore <br>
Afraid that I can do something for you to hate me. <br>

So go ahead test me <br>
I will at least try <br>
Because that is the least I can do <br>
I will try over and over again to win your heart <br>

And when my days are done for <br>
When I have no more strength to continue <br>
When the days take to long to end <br>
I will remember every battle I fought for you <br>
And smile will come to my face <br>
And my  heart will beat again <br>
