Two rings. One with a skull another with a gun <br>
Beware of the snake in your garden praying on the weak <br>
Love is poison if laced with hate <br>
Thrust is dead if it is not given freely without debt. <br>
Appearances are deceiving so are smiles <br>
Evey teeth is a tale of betrayal or lies <br>
But in the darkest places there are still beacons of light <br>
Bad and Good Darkness and Light. Nother exist without counterparts <br>
Clouds of pain decor blue skies <br>
Rain of fire is vengeance to the poisoned one <br>
Gratitude is a rare condition of the human kind <br>
It was long ago that we stopped being afraid of what lurks in the dark <br>
But the instincts are there. They sleep until the time is right <br>
Fear, confusion, pain, depression and entropy <br>
Are as core to the human condition as love, happiness, and order. <br>
