She follows me around in iron chains<br>
Gave into my eyes and you will find her<br>
Those who know me enough can tell<br>
She walks with me in hell<br>

Darkness is her weapon in this deep well<br>
When she wants to hurt me, she does<br>
She keeps me locked! that's how it always goes<br>
She walks with me in hell<br>

Can I kill you in this place?<br>
Yes. Go ahead. End my misery.<br>
But she loves the mystery<br>
She walks with me in hell<br>

Never mind the dry tears that build my cell <br>
I'm her prisoner with an infinite sentence <br>
From this hole there is no repentance
She walks with me in hell <br>

Cry in the shower or the rain <br>
That way she cant see your pain <br>
She prays on the weak <br>
She walks with me in hell <br>

Death is the sweet relieve I repel <br>
Those suicidal thoughts are difficult to shake <br>
She laughs from the corner when they stay <br>
She walks with me in hell <br>

Her name is depression!<br>
and she can go fuck herself<br>

By The Lonely Ones<br>

**Special note:**<br> 
This poem is dedicated to those lonely souls that roam this earth.
We fight the same enemy and we will not bow.
