We are unique <br>
Two souls that are bound by an eternal love <br>
and I will gladly break myself into pieces for you <br>
I know I love in this world <br>
and across all realities our hearts find each other <br>
here, there, and everywhere <br>
Chloe! we are meant for each other <br>
whether this thing we call destiny is real or not <br>
we found each other once <br>
We will do it one more time <br>
A loop of love unbroken <br>
that holds the test of time <br>
that survives all mistakes <br>
A rock unmovable by this sea of troubles <br>
