I know you more than he will ever try to know you <br>
I know your kinks even the ones you don't talk about <br>
I learn to read your body <br>
To identify the subtle movements that make you climax <br>

I recognize your anger a mile away <br>
I see the true meaning of your tears <br>
And the lies of your laughs <br>
I know you like he could never dream possible <br>

So say yes!
Please say yes to one more time <br>
Decline his call and take mine <br>
Take my hand and ignore the rest <br>

So say yes! <br>
There wont be no regrets <br>
For some time we can forget <br>
Say yes and I will never say no. <br>
