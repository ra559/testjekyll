I have no reason to move on <br>
I have no reason to live <br>
I have nothing because she was everything <br>
And I lost. <br>

He has everything that means my world <br>
And he does not know her value <br>
He does not know anything <br>
He thinks he is a winner <br>
But he does not know the value of her <br>

What is the point of existing? <br>
Living in a world where I am not her man <br>
Where I am nothing <br>
Where every day I wake up I crave her love <br>
Her time! That which he has and I don’t! <br>

Why keep living this life? <br>
Why bother? <br>
There is no higher reason than my love for her <br>
I wish she knew how much she means to me <br>
I wish I could find the words to express it <br>

I don’t live for me <br>
I live for those who will miss me when I’m gone <br>
I do the things they expect because I don’t want to be a burden <br>
Because all I want to be is her man <br>

And I will live every day that I have left <br>
Poisoning myself <br>
Hoping for the sweet relief that will end <br>
Hoping that maybe one day  <br>
After all is done and all is said <br>
I find a reason to live this life other than pretending. <br>
