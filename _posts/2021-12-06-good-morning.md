It is that simple text message that brightens my day <br>
Specially when I oversleep <br>
Knowing that you care to wish me a good day <br>
That alone makes it worth living <br>
That alone does more that the morning coffee <br>
I am a Good morning addict, when they come from you <br>
They are powerful, lovely, and enchanting <br>
So good morning my love. Good Morning Chloe! <br>
