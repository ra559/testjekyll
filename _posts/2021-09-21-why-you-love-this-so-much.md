She asks me as if she does not know <br>
That her kisses are the sweetest thing in world <br>
They trigger my diabetes <br>
They kickstart my heart  <br>
And if I die, they could revive. <br>

They are electric and  soft <br>
I can never get enough <br>
Can't she see she is my cocaine? <br>
My novocaine for the pain <br>
My pain killers for the soul and this hurt? <br>

Well if she did not know,
That I die for those kisses every night <br>
Now she certainly knows <br>
And over time I will convince her of my words <br>

God damn it! Would I be able to kiss her again
Maybe tomorrow, in an hour of simply any time today? <br>
I will have to escape from this schedule and meet her <br>
Anywhere you want my love, as long as your kisses I own <br>

One day if I lose your kisses all will be gone <br>
I won't kiss no other lips like yours <br>
The sweet nectar of your tongue <br>
The beautiful mental trip they take me skin to bone! <br>

You know what else I love? <br>
How your skin gets when I steal one of them <br>
When by surprise our lips met <br>
Maybe you noticed but when we kiss you smile as well <br>
