When insomnia takes hold of you <br>
Keeps you, prisoner, in a cell of pain <br>
Right there in those sleepless nights <br>
Call me and I will pick you up. <br>

When the memories of all we did together <br>
Run in your head like a Nascar race <br>
When the scars of my kisses are the only thought <br>
Call me and I will pick you up. <br>

Every time you drive through that hotel in 46 <br>
Whether he is next to you or not <br>
And the adventure of our love distracts you from life  <br>
Call me and I will pick you up. <br>

Because I will always be a phone call away <br>
The distance between you and me <br>
Is and will always be the time it takes to text me <br>
And I will meet you there in the place you pick. <br>
