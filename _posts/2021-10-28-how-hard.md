I will hug you so hard that my skin will merge with yours making one <br>
I will hug you so hard that my perfume will impregnate yours and make a single scent <br>
A scent that will last till the end of  times <br>
I will do it this way just in case life takes you away from me once again <br>
You will have something else other than my poems to remember my name. <br>

I will hug harder than the atoms form in solid metal <br>
Our hug will be so sweet and long that the air will leave our bodies <br>
Our souls will remember their love for each other <br>
And our lips will dance an eternal dance of lovers. <br>

I will  hug you for so long <br>
That the minutes will be turned into years <br>
And those years into a life together with no tears <br>
A life that will repeat itself over and over like a forever turning gear <br>
l will make you feel that time does not exist my dear. <br>

I will hug you so hard, that the week you spend away from me <br>
Will feel like a day instead of an eternal year that took to long to leave <br>
So hard, that you will complain but don't want to let me go <br>
So hard, that it will redefine the definition of the word love. <br>

And I will kiss you, yes I will, Like I have never before <br>
I will kiss you and give you all this suppressed loved left behind <br>
And hug you, again and again until you curse the time to go home. <br>
Until you curse every minute you are not with me. <br>

I will hug you so hard <br>
That the explosion that made the world <br>
Will make another one between us <br>
A world of love, peace, passion and sex <br>
A world only for the two of us. <br>

That is how hard I want to hug you,  <br>
to love you like no other,  <br>
to kiss you every time like the last,  <br>
to make love to you the magic way you like.  <br>
These hours are taking too long  <br>
And the plane is way too slow. <br>
