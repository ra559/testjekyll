If I die tonight <br>
I know I will be missed by a few people <br>
Maybe for the first 3 days and the memory of me fades away <br>

But if I really die tonight <br>
Let everyone know that I tried <br>
That I loved for real <br>

Let the world know that hate was never in me <br>
That while I got angry and said some things I did not mean <br>
I still did not hate those who wrong me <br>

And if tonight is the last time you get to kiss me <br>
Do it like the first and last time <br>
Make it so it last you a lifetime <br>

But if I do not die tonight <br>
Repeat this poem the next day <br>
As my wish is to be loved by you and no one else.  <br>
