If you ask me to leave you, I leave. <br>
If you ask me to hate you, Iâ€™ll pretend.<br>
If you ask me to love you, I already do.<br>
But if you ask me to forget you, I can't.<br>

If you want a life without me, I will go away<br>
I will love you in the distance.<br>
Miles away I will wish for you wellbeing<br>
I will celebrate your success<br>
I will cry at your wedding and bless your children.<br>

If you don't want to play with me, I will try to understand.<br>
But if you want my heart to stop beating for yours, go get a gun<br>
Kill me and my heart will stop<br>
Because days will come and go, but I will always remain in love.<br>

If the world want us apart, we can try<br>
But we will fail miserably<br>
The will to see each other is too strong<br>
And whether we like it or not, our lips will meet again<br>
Maybe not in this life but certainly in the next.<br>
