Don't let me go <br>
If I leave I will bring you with me <br>
Hug me tight like if it is my last day <br>
Don't let me get away. <br>

I cannot live if the world does not have you <br>
Please stay. This bed is too cold <br>
Or take me with you. <br>
Wherever you are, it is warm. <br>

Rain is fire without your arms <br>
The heavens fall on me without your lips <br>
So let me keep them here <br>
To prevent the world from collapsing <br>

In my eyes you are everything to me <br>
I love you. Stay <br>
Or leave but let your love stay with me <br>
And come back for me <br>
