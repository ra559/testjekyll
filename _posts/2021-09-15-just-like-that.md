just like that she breaks me <br>
She makes me weak even on my strongest day <br>
Just two words and I am done <br>
When did she get this strong? <br>
When did I become so weak? <br>

A song, a line, a text, a call <br>
The simplest thing brings down to dust <br>
How come? How in the world is this possible? <br> 
A pair of words should not cause this <br>
But the words come from her! <br>

This makes no sense! <br>
In a world where a man has everything <br>
Nothing should be taken away <br>
But my heart is not in my chest <br> 
It is somewhere no one knows how to get. <br>
