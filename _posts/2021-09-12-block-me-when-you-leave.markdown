I cannot promise that in my time of need I won't call  <br>
I cannot promise that my heart won't miss you <br>
I cannot promise that when the urge to feel your skin melting into mine, I won't book a trip  <br>
I cannot promise that I will not love you.  <br>

Save yourself because it is too late for me  <br>
You are ingrained in my heart and body  <br>
Every inch of me misses every inch of you  <br>
I cannot live in a world where I don't need you   <br>

You need to enjoy your time  <br>
You need to disconnect.  <br>
You need to not miss me.  <br>
I cannot be sure of myself alone  <br>
 
When you leave, I will miss you  <br>
When you come back, I will look for you  <br>
When I leave. I won't be missed  <br>
When I come back. It won't matter  <br>
