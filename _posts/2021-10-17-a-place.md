I want you to know a lot of things <br>
To know that no matter how many years go by <br>
With me you will always have a place to be <br>
A place where you belong <br>
A place where your true colors are always beautiful <br>
Where the sun always shines in your favor <br>
Where a crazy man dies to see you smile again <br>
Where even the storms are good <br>
I want you to know that you will always have me <br>
That we will always have us <br>
