**Her:** Look aren't they beautiful <br>
**Him:** Yes, the seem to shine the brightest when they are about to die <br>
**Here:** Why are you so gloomy? <br>
**Him:** I am not! It is just the way they are. They shine and die. Like us <br>

**Him:** No we won't. We will live forever here. In this holy place. <br>
