I like doing the little things <br>
Those who make you smile from time to time <br>
I know I do not have to do them <br>
I know it is not a thing you look forward to <br>
But I look forward to that smile <br>
That smile that brightens my day <br>

It is always the little things we miss <br>
You smile, your looks, your tender touches <br>
Those are things I cherish the most <br>
And every day I get at least one of those <br>
I feel good. I feel high. I feel my best. <br>

I will keep doing the small things <br>
Even if I donâ€™t ever see you again <br>
I will still make those things a core part of my day <br>
Because may, even if only pictures, I get to see that smile again. <br>
