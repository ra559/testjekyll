Let me see you tonight <br>
At least for a second <br>
A second that for you may be just time  <br>
But for me it is an eternity <br>

Let me kiss those lips <br>
Fast! I know that you gotta go <br>
But I cannot stay away from you <br>
Because that is the power you have  <br>

Let me take you away <br>
They will never know <br>
Or even if they knew  <br>
Love is risky baby let's do it anyways <br>

Its cold out here <br>
I want you to hurry up <br>
Tell those people you will be right back <br>
And come kiss me good night <br>
