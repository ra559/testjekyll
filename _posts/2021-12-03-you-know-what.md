That is the past. We cannot fix it.  <br>
I prefer to look at things this way.  <br>
After all that happened, we still love each other. <br> 
If that is not worth living for then call me crazy  <br>

If we did not love each other, we would be hating each other right now.  <br>
Yet we make love like never before,  <br>
we kiss like never before,  <br>
we appreciate each other like never before  <br>
If this is not special then someone tell me what is.  <br>

We can be honest with each other and admit our mistakes  <br>
If that is not worth fighting for then nothing is.  <br>
When I look at you, I do not see the past,  <br>
I do not see who you were or your mistakes. <br>
I only see what we are now and what we could be eventually  <br>

I don't want to lose this I feel for you  <br>
I know that it is unique <br>
like you there will never be anyone else <br>
You are and will always be my only one.  <br>

The one that gets me.  <br>
The one that is precious.  <br>
The one I won't get away.  <br>
The one I want to die along side with  <br>

I will tolerate anything that comes my way  <br>
nothing is bigger than this I feel for you  <br>
I will deal with your mother’s twisted view of me <br>
I will deal with the world’s hypocrisy  <br>

I do not ask anything of you <br>
I choose to love you and fight for you
Do not ask me to forget you because I cant and wont <br>
Do not ask me to stop loving you because it is not possible <br>

You can ask me to leave and I will try to <br>
I will not bother you or look for you <br>
If that is your wish then I will comply <br>
But not ask me to give up because your mother does not like me <br>
Because that is a weak reason to stop loving you <br>

One day she will realize that her point of view is not absolute <br>
And I will be there to tell her that I never hated her <br>
That I am simply patient to this love I feel <br>
That I accept her as she is and I am willing to change my ways for you <br>
