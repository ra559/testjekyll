When I lost you, I lost myself <br>
I lost everything that matter to me <br>
I lost everything that was worth fighting <br>
So I miss you like a soldier misses the smell of a home-cooked meal. <br>

Every night I replay our love story in mind <br>
And I miss you like an insomniac misses sleep <br>
I relive every beautiful moment <br>
Every smile you gave me. Every Good morning. <br>

I miss you saying “Ya me voy” <br>
I miss myself saying. “Hold on ya subo” <br>
I miss that goodbye kiss in the car <br>
I miss bringing you food to work. <br>

I miss being your man <br>
Because it was not the sex or the bed <br>
It was the company that made me fall in love <br>
And I miss that company like I would miss air in space. <br>

The way I miss you no one will ever do <br>
Because it is your smell in the morning  <br>
When I wake up in the solitude of this hell <br>
That my heart cries for. Every morning and all day. <br>

And yes! I will always miss you <br>
Because you are the best thing that ever happened to me <br>
And I am the biggest loser the world will ever see <br>
With you left happiness and everything else <br>
So I fucking miss you and I always will. <br>
