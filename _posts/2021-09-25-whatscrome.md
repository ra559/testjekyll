On my PC I  open WhatsApp Chrome <br>
Looking for a notification that takes too long to come <br>
Honestly, right after I reply and before I change the song <br>
I am already waiting to ready what she sends me along. <br>

The hardest part is waiting when I surely know <br>
That she cannot text me or call <br>
Because at the moment she has no time for me <br>
But for her, I have the whole clock. <br>

She is probably getting tired of my presence <br>
That is probably why she wants me to forget her <br>
So she can have peace without all this noise  <br>
Peace knowing that I am nowhere reachable by choice. <br>

How can I choose to leave? <br>
That is not an option to achieve <br>
I rather work on everything I did <br>
Wait all my life for her to see. <br>
