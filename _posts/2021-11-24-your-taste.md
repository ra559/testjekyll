![eating you](https://tfln.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mhSn5CL.gif)

I know I talked about this before <br>
But I have to say it again <br>
And as many times as I need to <br>
You taste amazing <br>

Kissing you is all I want to do <br>
Eating you out is all I think about <br>
When the thoughts of love making invades my mind <br>
I imagine myself making you climax with my tongue <br>

What can I say? <br>
If you taste this great <br>
I cannot stop myself from loving it <br>
I cannot bring myself to stop doing it <br>

So what do you say? <br>
Would you let me have you again? <br>
Will you let me make you see the stars again? <br>
If so, lets make it soon. I cannot wait to explore your body again. <br>

With love, desire, and hunger <br>
Lucifer. <br>
