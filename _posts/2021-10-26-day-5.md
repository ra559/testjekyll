**Song of the day:** [Realmente no estoy tan solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJeAYCYywjI) - Ricardo Arjona <br>

Today rains in Jersey <br>
The cold rain screams “come back soon” <br>
This melancholic morning makes me crave your skin <br>
Warm and soft next to me in bed <br>
That is my heaven. I do not want to leave <br>
There is nothing warmer than waking up with you on a cold morning like this. <br>

I want to see you changing for work at 5:30 AM <br>
Admire every curve in your body as you cover it <br>
Remember what happened the night before <br>
And fall asleep as soon as you leave <br>
Just to dream of you over and over. <br>

Is it healthy to love you this way? <br>
I don’t know. <br>
But I will rather be sick than healthy without you. <br>

I miss you. Come back soon. <br>
I started to miss you that friday morning you left <br>
You boarded a plane but it landed in my head <br>
Nothing has taken you off my thoughts <br>
Every song, movie, and picture has your name. <br>
