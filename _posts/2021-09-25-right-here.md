I want to have you right here <br>
Whisper sweet words in your ear <br>
Kiss it gently and get you a beer <br>
Play a movie or some music we hold dear. <br>

Have you laying your head on my shoulder <br>
Then move your head gently and kiss me softly <br>
Touch those sweet lips I love awfully <br>
Get you warm in the right places logically. <br>

I want you to fantasize while the movie plays <br>
See your dreamy eyes forget this love in decay <br>
And before the movie gets any further begin the foreplay <br>
With my right hand touching right where you prefer <br>

I want to make love to you today <br>
The kind of love that keeps you smiling the next day <br>
The kind that takes your stress away <br>
The kind that makes us fall in love this way. <br>
