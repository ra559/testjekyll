It is hard to suppress the urges to talk <br>
Every day I want to hear your voice <br>
I know this will never end <br>
I just hope you feel the same <br>

If only I could turn back time <br>
I would hold you tight till its a crime <br>
A piece of me is missing <br>
I just keep repeating our memories of kissing <br>

That night when we met <br>
I never thought I'd fall in love again <br>
But time has a funny way to tell <br>
How foolish a man can get <br>

Till the end of times, I will remember the M&Ms <br>
Every time I go to the store, I'll remember my nickname <br>
Tu Tiguere De Los Mensajes Raros will always be your man <br>
this love will go on until nothing is left <br>

Or until one day we look at each other and make love again. <br>

Wish I could, I could've said goodbye <br>
I would've said what I wanted to <br>
Maybe even cried for you <br>
If I knew it would be the last time <br>
I would've broke my heart in two <br>
Tryna save a part of you <br>
