We all do things in our dreams<br>
Things we would not dare to do<br>
Some of us do things in real life<br>
Things we would never see with our eyes.<br>

In my dreams we are lovers<br>
In real, a desired undiscovered<br>
Reality and fantasy devided by a line covered<br>
By a pile of lies we hide from others<br>

There is a fine line between dream and nightmare<br>
In a dream, we are hotter than summer<br>
In a nightmare, lost forever in arms of others<br>
In reality, our love sees no clutter.<br>
