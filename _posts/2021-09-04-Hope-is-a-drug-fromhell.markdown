Whats your poison? - The bartender asked.  <br>
Do you have something for the love sick? - I said <br>
Nothing kills love. But I have novocaine <br>
Then give me whatever you have that can kill the brain <br>

What are you doing here? - Said the woman in the black skirt <br>
I'm here because my heart is somewhere else. - Said me, the man on the red shirt <br>
Ouch! she must be either special or cruel enough to hate <br>
She is both. One day special; another cruel as hell <br>

Do you want to dance? - said she now showing a bit more leg <br>
Sorry, but she tried to teach me and I never learned <br>
Don't worry, I don't know much other than what I do in bed <br>
Then we can skip the dance, get a meal, and do what you do best <br>

Here is the drink buddy - the bartender said <br>
His name is Carlos. He is being for a long time as you can tell <br>
Well mine is Bobby - I tell her <br>
Rebecca - She says it with smile in her face <br>

We had our last drink and went to a hotel <br>
One I have never been before. The others still have your smell <br>
She was right about what she new best <br>
We made it like 4 times and they were all great. <br>

We did not make love. It was not meant for her<br>
We had sex. The type you have  with anyone else <br>
There were no passionate kiss in the end <br>
There was no sternal hug to sleep on. To lose myself <br>

Maybe I'll see Rebecca again. <br>
Maybe, if it keeps happening, I will find you in her <br>
I know I wont. Hope is a drug from hell. <br>
But till my last day, I'll look for you in every woman I can get <br>
