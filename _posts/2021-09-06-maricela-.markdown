I saw her again. Maricela. She asked me about you <br>
She does that all the time <br>
She wants to know if we still talk <br>
I told her no. I lied. <br>
I do not want to hurt her. She has been good to me <br>
But how can I tell her that my heart beats for you? <br>
How can I tell her that I drive by your job to see your smile <br>
How can I tell her that I think of you when we make love. <br>

Two nights ago I almost said your name in the end. <br>
But even if I had said it, she would stay. <br> 
I don't know what she sees in me. She should leave me <br>
I know I scream your name in my sleep <br>
She knows it too. <br>
I guess she loves me in a special way. <br>
A way I cannot reciprocate. <br>

Maricela. Why do you do this to yourself? <br>
Don't you know I am broken. <br>
Broken people cant be fixed <br>
I guess she clings to the idea of putting the pieces of my heart together <br>
maybe if she does I could love her. <br>
