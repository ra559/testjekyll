You want to go away.<br>
Those are the words you say<br>
But you skiing says otherwise<br>
You lips cry for mine<br>

You want me to leave<br>
But your heart wants me to stay<br>
You tell everyone that I am history<br>
But in your car we keep making memories of today<br>

You say things you don't mean<br>
Because what you want to say you canâ€™t repeat<br>
Your dream of me and I dream of you<br>
And therefore I wont leave<br>

You want to leave<br>
Go ahead  kill me<br>
That is the only way<br>
Because years from now you will see<br>
That my eyes have the same glow when you see me.<br>
