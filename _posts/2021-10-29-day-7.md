I'm not giving up on you that easy <br>
Not without a fight <br>
One who loves must fight till defeat or success <br>
Otherwise, love is an empty word. <br>

Give me a reason to give you up without a fight? <br>
Give me a reason to move on without knowing? <br>
Give me a reason why I should pass the chance to be happy with you? <br>
If you are not willing to do anything for love, then you never really loved. <br>

This is worth the fight even if I lose in the end <br>
Because I want to tell myself and you  <br>
That I did everything I could <br>
I know sometimes I say the wrong things <br>
But I do it because I want you to see honesty in me <br>

And yes, I miss you and it broke me for a bit <br>
But it took a single text from you to know that everything will be alright <br>
I was never going to stop writing for you <br>
I simply thought that maybe I was making you sad  <br>
And therefore you did not want to talk to me. <br>

Don't you see that I will do anything for the chance to see you? <br>
But don't worry, if you don't see it now, I will show you then <br>
I will do whatever it takes to see your eyes again <br>
You do not know how madly in love I am with you <br>
And I know that if I don't try, I did not deserve you in the first place <br>

You will always know that there was once a man that did everything for you <br>
That appreciates you above and beyond the sex and touches <br>
That sees you as his queen as his everything <br>
And even if you hate me after the fact <br>
I will keep on loving you in secret <br>
Away, but still close to you <br>

I know probably don't believe me <br>
But time will show you that my feelings for you are honest <br>
Even if I have to spend the rest of my life pretending  <br>
Even if I die alone waiting for another chance <br>
I love you know. I will keep on loving you tomorrow, and till death takes me away <br>
I will always be Tu Tiguere De Los Mensajes Raros <br>
Tu lucifer y tu mi Chloe <br>
Because I cannot erase the best thing that ever happened to me <br>
And if you want to try to erase me go ahead, I won't stop you. <br>

Así con toda mi loquera <br>
Con mi honestidad que a veces duele <br>
Yo no te olvidare jamas <br>
Tu fuiste y siempre seras mi mas bella historia de amor <br>

¿Cómo pretendes que simplemente me olvide de ti? <br>
Cuando una sola mirada me vuelve el hombre más feliz <br>
Cuando un beso tuyo me dura todo el dia <br>
Y me la paso saboreando tus labios hasta el proximo beso <br>

How can I possibly not miss you? <br>
When no one else can occupy your space <br>
When no one else can do a third of the things you do without even trying <br>
You are the most wonderful person I ever met <br>
The one I will never remove from life <br>
And somehow I should just accept that you hate me? 
That you want nothing to do with me? After 6 years of turbulence? <br>
I rather accept death.  <br>

If they don't want to understand that  <br>
Then let them be shallow and not understand <br>
But I do know what love is <br>
I do know what you mean to me <br>
And I will do anything to show them that. <br>
