I want to sleep with you <br>
This time I do not mean sex <br>
I do not mean love either <br>
I want to lay next to you for hours to come. <br>

I want to fall asleep next to you <br>
I want the comforting sensation that you will never leave <br>
I want to pass out intoxicated with your smell <br>
Dream of you while knowing you will be there when I wake up. <br>

I don’t care if it is just for a couple of hours <br>
Those hours will last forever in my head <br>
Dreaming has a way of making us lose track of time <br>
Sometimes 8 hours feel like 1 minute. <br>

So yes, I want to fall asleep with you next to me this time <br>
Don’t get me wrong! If I could make love to you and sleep I would do both <br>
But I know that I need to pick one of the two <br>
And falling asleep next to you is what I want this time around. <br>
