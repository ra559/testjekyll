Gray clouds have tainted my blue sky <br>
They bring the temptation of rain <br>
The threat of heavy water prevents the fly <br>
Their shape is tattoed in the heavens with pain. <br>

The crops are putrid in the ground <br>
The solid where seeds were panted <br>
Now is poisoned and the goods are drowned <br>
In the sorrow, melody by my soul chanted. <br>

It does not seem like the rain will fall <br>
Will they go away and bring the sun? <br>
Or will they disappear one day? <br>
Leaving everything empty, blue, and dull. <br>

The storm passed and clouds remain <br>
They adorn the day blocking the light  <br>
They chill the night leaving death behind <br>
They perfume the air with toxins that blind. <br>
