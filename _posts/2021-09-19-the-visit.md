Neither of was was nervous <br>
We both dream of this moment a while back <br>
A moment where we decided not care about other but us <br>
And when we met, a few words were said, tons of kisses given, and love was made. <br>

She left and I stayed <br>
Wondering when will be the next time <br>
When I get to make her mine <br>
And she get to give happiness a chance. <br>

I had a headache and I went to bed <br>
I dream of her warm body again melting with mine <br>
While I eat her whole world <br>
While I loved her again and again on repeat <br>

I want to kiss her right now <br>
I want to see her and hug her <br>
She looks amazing naked <br>
But she looks better when I'm on top. <br>
