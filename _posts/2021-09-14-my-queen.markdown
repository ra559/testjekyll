She says she doesn't feel like a queen <br>
How does a queen feel? <br>
She reigns in my heart and body <br>
She governs every one of my thoughts <br>
In my eyes she is my queen <br>
She may not like it when I say it <br>
But I wonâ€™t stop saying it <br>

She says she needs to work on looking like a queen <br>
I wish she could see herself through my eyes <br>
She will see how perfect she is <br>
Then she will stop working so hard to achieve what she already has <br>

Maybe I need to make her feel like a queen <br>
Love her harder <br>
Kisser her harder <br>
Giver her more <br>

One day she will see it like I do <br>
And she will smile and look at me <br>
Then I will kiss her the same way <br>
And we will make love again. <br>
