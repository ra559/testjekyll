I write for a lot of reasons <br>
But all of them can be explained in a single sentence <br>
I write for you <br>

I write so you can see yourself from my eyes <br>
So you can see how perfect you are  <br>
How I see you as a goddess <br>

I write so I can explain how much  <br>
How much I love you <br>
How much I miss you <br>
How much I wish you heart belong to me <br>

I write because it is the only way <br>
To show you you matter  <br>
To show you that you are my life <br>
To show you that I will do anything for you <br>

I write because I want to yell  <br>
Yell to the world that I love Chloe <br>
Yell to them that this love is too strong to kill <br>
Yell that I wish I was enough to deserve you. <br>
