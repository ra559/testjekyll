You are going to miss me and I am going to miss you <br>
When you phone rings, a small part of you will think is me <br>
When I get a notification, all of me will hope is you <br>
I don't do custom ringtones. I want that whole to keep thinking it is you <br>

Years will go by and the same thing will happen <br>
I won't talk to you and you won't talk to me <br>
I will move on and you will do whatever <br>
But I will be waiting for that text, phone call, or letter. <br>
 
The big question is will you? <br>
Will you get excited if I call? <br>
Will you smile if I text? <br>
Will I be sad if I don't write poems anymore? <br>

The real question is Will you still love me <br>
After all my mistakes <br>
After all the heartbreaks <br>
After I get tired. Will you still love me? <br>
