Let me be rock in your difficult days <br>
If it is raining too hard, iâ€™ll be your umbrella <br>
When you need someone to complain about life <br>
Here are a pair of ears you can always use. <br>

If your day feels too long <br>
Give me a chance to end it right <br>
I will look deep into your eyes <br>
Reassure you that life, while hard, it is still worth it. <br>
