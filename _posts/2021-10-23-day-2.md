**Song of the day:** [Keep On Loving You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDJPpG8e4n4) - Cigarettes After Sex <br>

I don’t know how <br>
But one night just like now <br>
We managed to lose our bows <br>

To break the iron forged by a promise <br>
We let the time go by unnoticed <br>
Cold and stale became our bodies <br>

“I’ll love you forever” <br>
Good memories are full of anger <br>
Our looks and touches are no longer tender <br>

Could we recover ourselves from this hell? <br>
My soul and body still fall for your spell <br>
Those lips that know me too well <br>

Could we make love again? <br>
Tell me it is not too late <br>
To feel our bodies melting and going insane. <br>

I missed you today <br>
I missed you yesterday as well <br>
Only from you, I craved a good morning text. <br>
