**Don't be nervous** - I told her. <br>
**Who told you I am?** - She said <br>

I could see her trembling <br>
I could see the doubts in her eyes <br>
I could imagine what she was thinking <br>
But I did not want to ask.  <br>
I simple stole a kiss like every time <br>

She never denies me  <br>
She wants me as much as I want her <br>
She fantasies with me as much as I do with her <br>
I am in her dreams in the same way she is in mine. <br>

Every time I see her I want to make her mine <br>
I do not know what she thinks when she sees me <br>
Her eyes are good at hiding that <br>
But I know when she wants me and I oblige. <br>

I may be crazy for holding tight  <br>
I may be insane for wanting her back <br>
But this I tell you with no lie <br>
I am in love with her and thatâ€™s impossible to hide. <br>
